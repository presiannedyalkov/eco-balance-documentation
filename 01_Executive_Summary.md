# Executive Summary

---

## Project Vision

Eco Balance is an ambitious holistic environmental restoration initiative designed to combat climate change through ecosystem regeneration. Unlike conventional reforestation projects, Eco Balance takes an integrated systems approach that addresses soil health, water management, biodiversity conservation, community engagement, and technological innovation simultaneously.

---

## Core Mission

To restore degraded ecosystems in Southern Europe through evidence-based, community-engaged, financially sustainable environmental restoration that serves as a replicable model for global climate action.

> **📘 Bootstrap Model Note:**
> Eco Balance uses a phased approach starting with a 1-hectare Year 1 pilot (€20k-€30k, 1-2 founders) to prove the concept before scaling to 5-10 hectares in Years 2-3 (€250k-€500k, 3-4 staff). This ensures viability before major investment.

## Why Now?

### The Crisis
- **Climate Change:** Temperatures rising, extreme weather increasing
- **Biodiversity Loss:** 73% decline in wildlife populations since 1970
- **Soil Degradation:** 33% of global soils degraded
- **Water Scarcity:** 2 billion people lack safe drinking water

→ Context in [[02_Project_Vision|Project Vision & Context]]

### The Solution
Holistic ecosystem restoration that:
- Sequesters carbon
- Restores biodiversity
- Rebuilds soil health
- Secures water resources
- Creates sustainable livelihoods

---

## What Makes Us Different

Most reforestation projects focus only on tree planting. **Eco Balance rebuilds entire ecosystems** with integrated approaches to:
- Soil restoration
- Water management
- Biodiversity conservation
- Community empowerment
- Technology integration
- Financial sustainability

This comprehensive approach creates lasting, transformative change.
