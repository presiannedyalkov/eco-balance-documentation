**Purpose:** Comprehensive guidance templates for AI assistants managing the Eco Restoration Project

**Version:** 1.0.0 (deprecated)
**Last Updated:** October 29, 2025

---

## Overview

This directory contains detailed "skill" templates that guide AI assistants in performing specific roles within the project. Each skill template prevents common AI problems like context loss, timeout errors, focus drift, and inconsistent output.

### What Are Skills?

Skills are **operational frameworks** that provide:
- Clear role definitions with explicit scope
- Step-by-step workflows with time limits
- Decision trees for common scenarios
- Quality standards and checklists
- Handoff protocols for coordination
- Examples and anti-patterns
- Performance tracking mechanisms

### Why Skills Matter

AI assistants face several challenges:
- **Context Loss**: Forgetting earlier conversation
- **Timeout Errors**: Tasks taking too long
- **Focus Drift**: Veering off-task
- **Inconsistency**: Variable quality
- **Scope Creep**: Tasks expanding beyond intent

Skills solve these by providing structure, boundaries, and clear guidance.

## How to Use Skills

### For AI Assistants

When a user invokes a role:

1. **Load the skill file immediately**
   ```
   Read: ai_skills/[role_name].md
   ```

2. **Follow the workflow systematically**
   - Don't skip steps
   - Respect time limits
   - Use decision trees when uncertain
   - Follow quality checklists

3. **Document your work**
   - Update task status
   - Create completion reports
   - Flag issues appropriately
   - Update state files

4. **Know when to escalate**
   - Follow handoff protocols
   - Don't guess on important decisions
   - Provide clear context in escalations

### For Humans

When managing AI assistants:

1. **Invoke roles explicitly**
   ```
   "Act as Documentation Curator and update X"
   "Use the Research Analyst skill to investigate Y"
   ```

2. **Review outputs against skill standards**
   - Check quality checklists
   - Verify time limits were respected
   - Ensure scope boundaries maintained

3. **Provide feedback to improve skills**
   - Update skill templates based on experience
   - Add new decision trees as patterns emerge
   - Refine time estimates
   - Expand examples

## Coordination Between Roles

### Primary Relationships

```
Project Coordinator
    ├─ coordinates → Documentation Curator
    ├─ coordinates → Research Analyst
    ├─ coordinates → Community Liaison
    ├─ coordinates → Task Manager
    └─ oversees → Moderator

Documentation Curator
    ├─ requests research → Research Analyst
    ├─ submits for review → Quality Auditor
    └─ creates tasks → Task Manager

Community Liaison
    ├─ routes complex questions → Research Analyst
    ├─ escalates feedback → Moderator
    └─ coordinates answers → Documentation Curator

Quality Auditor
    ├─ validates → All roles
    ├─ reports to → Project Coordinator
    └─ creates quality tasks → Task Manager
```

### Coordination Principles

1. **Clear Handoffs**: Use standardized templates
2. **Context Preservation**: Document state thoroughly
3. **No Gaps**: Every task has clear ownership
4. **No Overlaps**: Defined boundaries between roles
5. **Feedback Loops**: Continuous improvement

## Creating New Skills

### When to Create a New Skill

Create a new skill when:
- A distinct role emerges with unique responsibilities
- Existing skills become too broad
- New project phase requires different approach
- Pattern of escalations suggests need for specialization

### Skill Creation Process

1. **Define the role clearly**
   - What's the primary purpose?
   - What problems does this solve?
   - What are the boundaries?

2. **Map the workflow**
   - What are the key steps?
   - What decision points exist?
   - Where are the handoffs?

3. **Establish standards**
   - What's good quality look like?
   - What metrics matter?
   - What are the time limits?

4. **Document pitfalls**
   - What commonly goes wrong?
   - How to recognize issues?
   - What are the solutions?

5. **Create examples**
   - Show best practices
   - Demonstrate decision trees
   - Include real scenarios

6. **Test and refine**
   - Run pilot sessions
   - Collect feedback
   - Update based on experience
   - Iterate continuously

---

## Quality Standards for Skills

All skills must:

✓ **Be specific**: Clear, actionable guidance
✓ **Set boundaries**: Explicit IN/OUT scope
✓ **Include timers**: Prevent runaway sessions
✓ **Provide examples**: Show, don't just tell
✓ **Enable handoffs**: Clear escalation protocols
✓ **Track performance**: Measurable metrics
✓ **Evolve**: Regular review and updates

---

## Version Control

Skills follow semantic versioning:

- **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Fundamental role changes
- **MINOR** (x.X.0): New features, expanded workflows
- **PATCH** (x.x.X): Clarifications, bug fixes

Track changes in each skill's version history section.
