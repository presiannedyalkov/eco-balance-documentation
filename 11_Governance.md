---

## 🎯 Decision Criteria: Which Governance Model?

**Decision Flow**:

1. **Which country are we operating in?**
   - Germany → e.V. (Year 1-2) or gGmbH (Year 3-5)
   - Portugal → Associação/IPSS
   - Spain/France/Italy → Local equivalent
   - Undecided → Informal Year 1, formalize when location clear

2. **Do we have €40k capital available?**
   - Yes + want investor-friendly structure → Consider gGmbH (Germany only)
   - No → e.V., Associação, or other low-cost option

3. **How important is founder control?**
   - Critical control → gGmbH (if €40k available) or Informal Year 1
   - Comfortable with democratic → e.V., Associação (lower cost, faster)

4. **Timeline urgency?**
   - Need structure in 4-8 weeks → e.V. (Germany), Informal
   - Can wait 2-4 months → Associação (Portugal), other EU
   - Can wait 3-6 months → gGmbH (Germany)

5. **Primary funding source?**
   - Grants and donations → e.V., Associação, IPSS (nonprofit credibility)
   - Commercial revenue or investors → gGmbH (commercial flexibility)
   - Bootstrap/crowdfunding → Any option works, choose by location

**Decision Timeline**:
- **Now - Month 6**: Explore options, defer decision pending location
- **Month 6**: Finalize location → triggers legal structure decision
- **Month 6-9**: Register legal entity (4-8 weeks for e.V., 2-4 months for Associação, 3-6 months for gGmbH)
- **Month 9-12**: Operational with legal structure in place

---

## 🔄 Current Status: Governance Decision

**Decided**:
- ✅ Core governance principles (transparency, accountability, ethics, founder control, donor trust)
- ✅ Governance will match chosen legal structure
- ✅ Year 1-2 founders retain operational control regardless of structure

**Actively Exploring** (no commitment yet):
- ⏳ Legal structure: e.V. vs Associação vs gGmbH vs other (decide when location clear)
- ⏳ Member composition: Who will be initial members if e.V./Associação (identify 5-7 trusted allies)
- ⏳ Advisory Board: Who to invite (expertise in restoration, finance, policy)

**Deferred Pending Location Decision**:
- Exact governance bodies (depends on legal structure)
- Registration timeline (depends on structure complexity)
- Governance documents (articles of association, bylaws - draft when structure chosen)

**Trigger Events** (decide immediately if these occur):
- **Location finalized (Month 6 or earlier)** → Choose legal structure within 2 weeks
- **€40k+ funding secured early** → Consider gGmbH option (Germany only)
- **Major grant opportunity tied to specific structure** → Adopt that structure

**Adaptation Note**: Detailed governance structure will be finalized once legal structure is chosen. The framework below provides universal policies that apply regardless of structure.

## 🎯 Current Status: Governance Planning

**Decided**:
- ✅ Governance principles and ethics framework (documented above)
- ✅ Universal policies apply regardless of structure (conflict of interest, financial, ethics, transparency)
- ✅ Founders retain control during establishment (Year 1-2)
- ✅ Transition to professional governance as organization grows (Year 2+)

**Actively Exploring**:
- ⏳ Which legal structure → determines governance model (e.V., Associação, gGmbH, other)
- ⏳ Initial member/shareholder composition (identify 5-7 trusted allies for e.V./Associação)
- ⏳ Advisory Board candidates (expertise in restoration, finance, policy, local knowledge)

**Deferred Pending Legal Structure Decision**:
- Exact Board composition and roles (depends on structure)
- Articles of association and bylaws (draft when structure chosen)
- Committee structure (depends on organizational size and complexity)
- Meeting schedules and formats (formalize when Board formed)

**Decision Timeline**:
- **Month 0-6**: Informal governance (founders only), explore legal structure options
- **Month 6**: Finalize location → triggers legal structure decision
- **Month 6-9**: Register legal entity, draft governance documents, recruit initial Board/members
- **Month 9-12**: Operational governance structure in place, first Board meetings

**Trigger Events**:
- **Location decided** → Choose legal structure within 2 weeks → Begin governance document drafting
- **€40k+ funding secured** → Consider gGmbH for enhanced founder control (Germany only)
- **Major grant awarded** → Accelerate legal registration to receive funds

**Adaptation Note**: Detailed governance structure (bodies, meetings, procedures) will be finalized once legal structure is chosen. Core principles and policies above apply universally.
