# Visit Sites

← Back to [[README|Implementation Tasks]] | [[00_Site_Selection_Overview|Site Selection Overview]]

---

## 📋 Purpose

There is no substitute for physically visiting potential sites. Remote research and data provide important information, but only an in-person visit reveals the true character, opportunities, and challenges of a location. Site visits allow you to assess conditions that cannot be captured in maps or documents, build local relationships, and make informed decisions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Physically assess site conditions and restoration potential
- Verify desk research findings
- Document site characteristics through photos and notes
- Meet landowners and community members in person
- Experience accessibility and logistics firsthand
- Identify opportunities and challenges not visible remotely
- Build local relationships and community understanding
- Make informed comparison between potential sites

## ⚠️ Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1: Limited Time**
- Problem: Too many sites, not enough time for thorough assessment
- Solution: Prioritize based on desk research. Do quick screening visit first, then detailed visit for top candidates. Allocate full day minimum for serious contenders.

**Challenge 2: Poor Weather**
- Problem: Rain, extreme heat, or dangerous conditions
- Solution: Reschedule if possible. Rain actually reveals drainage patterns. Bring appropriate gear. Safety first - don't risk injury.

**Challenge 3: Access Issues**
- Problem: Locked gates, unclear boundaries, difficult terrain
- Solution: Confirm access arrangements beforehand. Bring landowner contact info. Have backup routes. Know your physical limitations.

**Challenge 4: Language Barriers**
- Problem: Can't communicate effectively with landowner or locals
- Solution: Hire translator or bilingual guide. Use translation apps. Bring visual materials. Patience and respect go a long way.

**Challenge 5: Overwhelming Information**
- Problem: So much to observe, hard to capture everything
- Solution: Use systematic checklists. Take abundant photos. Record voice notes. Review and organize notes daily. Focus on deal-breakers first.

**Challenge 6: Emotional Attachment**
- Problem: Fall in love with site, lose objectivity
- Solution: Use systematic scoring. Consult with team. Sleep on it. Remember the mission. Have clear go/no-go criteria established beforehand.

**Challenge 7: Hidden Problems**
- Problem: Issues not visible without extensive time on-site
- Solution: Multiple visits at different times. Talk to neighbors. Research property history. Professional assessments before purchase. Include contingencies in offer.
