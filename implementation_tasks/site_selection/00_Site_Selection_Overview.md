## Resources Needed

**Expertise:**
- Ecologist for site assessment
- Soil scientist for testing
- Legal advisor for contracts
- Real estate professional (helpful)
- Local community liaison

**Budget Estimate:**
- Desktop research: €2,000-5,000
- Site visits (3-5 sites): €5,000-10,000
- Due diligence: €5,000-15,000
- Legal fees: €5,000-20,000
- **Total site selection:** €1,000-3,000 before purchase (Bootstrap Model: desktop research, 1-2 site visits)

**Land acquisition:** €2,000-15,000/hectare (or lease options). Bootstrap Model targets 1 hectare.

**Bootstrap Model Context:**
For the v2.0 Bootstrap Model: Simplified site selection focusing on 1 hectare pilot within €20-30k Year 1 total budget (including land, infrastructure, and operations). Founders conduct assessments with expert consultation as needed, reducing costs significantly compared to larger-scale operations.

## Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge:** Perfect sites unavailable or unaffordable
**Solution:** Adjust criteria, consider partnership models, phase acquisition, seek grants specifically for land

**Challenge:** Complex land ownership or legal issues
**Solution:** Invest in legal expertise early, consider lease arrangements, partner with landowners rather than purchase

**Challenge:** Local community opposition
**Solution:** Extensive consultation before commitment, involve community in site selection, demonstrate benefits clearly

**Challenge:** Regulatory barriers appear late in process
**Solution:** Research regulations earlier in process, engage authorities proactively, build relationships with permitting agencies
