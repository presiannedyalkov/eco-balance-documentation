## 📋 Purpose

After conducting thorough research, assessments, and site visits, it's time to synthesize all information and create a shortlist of the most suitable locations for your restoration project. This critical step requires balancing multiple factors - ecological potential, practical considerations, financial constraints, and strategic alignment with your mission.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Synthesize all research and assessment data
- Apply consistent evaluation criteria across all sites
- Create objective scoring system for comparison
- Identify top 2-3 candidate sites
- Document rationale for shortlist selections
- Prepare detailed site profiles for final decision
- Identify next steps for shortlisted sites

---

## 📝 Step-by-Step Shortlisting Process

### Step 1: Compile All Site Data

**Gather Information:**
- Desk research findings → [[01_Identify_Potential_Locations|Initial Research]]
- Land condition assessments → [[02_Evaluate_Land_Condition|Land Evaluation]]
- Restoration potential estimates → [[03_Estimate_Restoration_Potential|Restoration Potential]]
- Accessibility evaluations → [[04_Consider_Accessibility|Accessibility]]
- Regulatory research → [[05_Research_Local_Regulations|Regulations]]
- Landowner communication notes → [[06_Contact_Landowners|Landowner Contact]]
- Site visit reports → [[07_Visit_Sites|Site Visits]]

**Create Master Spreadsheet:**
- List all candidate sites
- Compile key data points for each
- Include costs and timelines
- Note opportunities and challenges
- Record stakeholder input
- Document regulatory status

### Step 2: Define Decision Criteria

**Essential Criteria (Must-Haves):**
These are non-negotiable - sites failing any of these are eliminated:

- [ ] **Legal Access:** Can legally acquire or lease the land
- [ ] **Budget Fit:** Acquisition costs within available budget
- [ ] **Size Appropriate:** 1 hectare for Bootstrap pilot (v2.0 Model)
- [ ] **Restoration Viable:** Degradation severe enough to justify intervention, but not impossible
- [ ] **Regulatory Feasible:** Can obtain necessary permits within reasonable timeline
- [ ] **Safety:** Safe for staff and visitors to access and work
- [ ] **Geographic:** Located in target region (Southern Europe)

**Sites failing essential criteria are eliminated immediately.**

**Bootstrap Model Site Size:**
- Year 1-3: 1 hectare pilot site (prove the model)
- Post-pilot: If successful, consider 5-10 ha replication sites
- Focus: Validation at small scale, not immediate large-scale operation
- Budget: 1 ha site fits within €20-30k Year 1 budget

### Step 3: Develop Scoring Matrix

**Weighted Scoring System:**

Create a systematic way to compare sites objectively:

#### A. Ecological Factors (35% weight)

| Criterion | Weight | Description | Score 1-5 |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Degradation Level | 8% | Severe enough to justify, possible to restore | ___ |
| Biodiversity Potential | 7% | Remnant species, habitat diversity potential | ___ |
| Soil Quality/Potential | 7% | Current condition, restoration feasibility | ___ |
| Water Availability | 7% | Natural sources, rainfall, harvesting potential | ___ |
| Climate Resilience | 6% | Ability to withstand climate stresses | ___ |

**Ecological Subtotal:** ___/25 × 35% = ___/35

#### B. Practical Factors (30% weight)

| Criterion | Weight | Description | Score 1-5 |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Accessibility | 10% | Road access, logistics, year-round viability | ___ |
| Infrastructure | 7% | Utilities, accommodation, existing structures | ___ |
| Size & Configuration | 7% | Appropriate size, good shape, usable area | ___ |
| Neighborhood Context | 6% | Compatible land uses, minimal conflicts | ___ |

**Practical Subtotal:** ___/20 × 30% = ___/30

#### C. Financial Factors (20% weight)

| Criterion | Weight | Description | Score 1-5 |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Acquisition Cost | 8% | Purchase/lease price within budget | ___ |
| Infrastructure Costs | 6% | Utilities, roads, buildings required | ___ |
| Operating Costs | 6% | Ongoing logistics, transport, maintenance | ___ |

**Financial Subtotal:** ___/15 × 20% = ___/20

#### D. Strategic Factors (15% weight)

| Criterion | Weight | Description | Score 1-5 |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Community Support | 5% | Local receptivity, partnership potential | ___ |
| Visibility & Impact | 4% | Demonstration value, replication potential | ___ |
| Research Potential | 3% | Academic interest, monitoring opportunities | ___ |
| Revenue Generation | 3% | Eco-tourism, carbon credits, other income | ___ |

**Strategic Subtotal:** ___/15 × 15% = ___/15

**TOTAL SITE SCORE:** ___/100

### Step 4: Score All Sites

**Apply Scoring System:**

Complete the scoring matrix for each candidate site:

**Scoring Guidelines (1-5 scale):**
- **5 = Excellent:** Exceptional, major advantage
- **4 = Good:** Above average, positive factor
- **3 = Adequate:** Acceptable, no major concern
- **2 = Poor:** Below standard, significant concern
- **1 = Very Poor:** Major problem, potential deal-breaker

**Be Honest and Objective:**
- Use consistent standards across sites
- Base scores on evidence, not emotions
- Involve multiple team members for objectivity
- Document rationale for each score
- Flag any uncertainties or missing data

**Example Site Comparison:**

| Site | Ecological | Practical | Financial | Strategic | TOTAL |
|------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Site A: Sierra Valle | 29/35 | 22/30 | 14/20 | 11/15 | **76/100** |
| Site B: Monte Verde | 32/35 | 18/30 | 16/20 | 13/15 | **79/100** |
| Site C: Rio Seco | 26/35 | 25/30 | 18/20 | 10/15 | **79/100** |
| Site D: Pinar Alto | 30/35 | 20/30 | 10/20 | 12/15 | **72/100** |

### Step 5: Analyze Scores and Identify Patterns

**Look Beyond Total Scores:**

- **High Scorers:** Obviously strong candidates
- **Close Scores:** Need deeper comparative analysis
- **Category Strengths:** Site A ecological, Site C practical/financial
- **Fatal Flaws:** Any category scoring below 50% of possible points?
- **Risk Assessment:** Low scores identify major risks → [[../../50_Risk_Assessment|Risk Assessment]]

**Consider Trade-offs:**

**Scenario 1: Perfect Ecology vs. Practical Challenges**
- Site scores 32/35 ecological but only 15/30 practical
- Question: Can practical challenges be overcome?
- Decision: If budgets allow infrastructure investment, maybe worth it

**Scenario 2: Easy Operations vs. Limited Impact**
- Site scores 28/30 practical but 22/35 ecological
- Question: Is restoration impact sufficient to justify?
- Decision: Depends on mission priorities and demonstration value

**Scenario 3: Financial Constraints**
- Multiple high-scoring sites, but acquisition costs vary widely
- Question: Is higher cost justified by higher potential?
- Decision: Factor in long-term financial sustainability

### Step 6: Conduct Sensitivity Analysis

**Test Your Assumptions:**

**"What If" Scenarios:**
- What if budget is 20% less than expected?
- What if permit timelines double?
- What if key landowner refuses to sell?
- What if climate predictions worsen?
- What if community opposition emerges?

**Adjust Scores:**
- Which sites remain viable under stress scenarios?
- Which are most resilient to uncertainty?
- Which have backup options or flexibility?

**Risk-Adjusted Scoring:**
- Reduce scores for high-uncertainty factors
- Increase scores for sites with clear path forward
- Consider probability of success, not just potential

### Step 7: Create Shortlist (2-3 Sites)

**Selection Criteria:**

**Ideal Shortlist:**
- Top 2-3 scoring sites that:
  - Pass all essential criteria
  - Score above 70/100 overall
  - No category below 50% of possible points
  - Clear path to acquisition
  - Acceptable risk profile
  - Aligned with organizational capacity

**Diversity in Shortlist:**
- Consider including different site types for comparison
- High ecological potential vs. high practical feasibility
- Different geographic locations or contexts
- Backup options if primary choice falls through

**Example Shortlist:**

**Primary Candidate: Monte Verde (79/100)**
- Strengths: Exceptional ecological potential, strong community support
- Weaknesses: Moderate accessibility challenges
- Rationale: Highest overall score, best balance of factors
- Next Steps: Begin detailed due diligence, start negotiations

## ⚠️ Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1: Analysis Paralysis**
- Problem: Too much data, can't make decision, keep researching
- Solution: Set decision deadline. Use scoring system to force prioritization. Remember: no site is perfect. Make best decision with available information.

**Challenge 2: Emotional Favorites**
- Problem: Team has different favorite sites based on personal preferences
- Solution: Return to objective scoring. Discuss specific concerns. Use weighted criteria to resolve ties. Leader makes final call if needed with clear rationale.

**Challenge 3: Close Scores**
- Problem: Multiple sites score very similarly, no clear winner
- Solution: Good problem to have! Identify differentiating factors. Consider strategic timing (which is available now?). Visit top sites again. Choose based on secondary criteria or gut instinct of team leader.

**Challenge 4: Top Site Has Major Flaw**
- Problem: Highest scoring site has one serious weakness
- Solution: Assess if flaw is fixable. Calculate cost/timeline to address. Compare to next-best option. Sometimes second-best with no major flaws is better choice.

**Challenge 5: Stakeholder Disagreement**
- Problem: Funders, advisors, or team members strongly disagree on choice
- Solution: Facilitate structured discussion. Identify root causes of disagreement. Seek compromise or creative solution. Document concerns and how addressed. Leadership makes final call but explains clearly.

**Challenge 6: New Information Emerges**
- Problem: During shortlisting, learn something that changes assessment
- Solution: Update scores immediately. Reassess if it changes rankings. Don't ignore new data. Better to adjust now than after commitment.

**Challenge 7: Perfect Site Unattainable**
- Problem: Top scoring site landowner won't sell, or price unrealistic
- Solution: This is why you have 2-3 on shortlist! Move to next option. Don't chase unattainable. Stay mission-focused, not site-focused.
