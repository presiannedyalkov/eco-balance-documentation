# Consider Accessibility

← Back to [[README|Implementation Tasks]] | [[00_Site_Selection_Overview|Site Selection Overview]]

---

## 📋 Purpose

Accessibility is a critical factor in site selection that impacts operational costs, team wellbeing, and project viability. A poorly accessible site can dramatically increase expenses and reduce effectiveness, even if the land itself is ideal for restoration.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Assess physical access routes to potential sites
- Evaluate infrastructure availability (roads, utilities)
- Consider logistics for staff, materials, and visitors
- Determine accommodation needs and options
- Calculate accessibility-related costs

---

## 📝 Step-by-Step Assessment

### Step 1: Evaluate Transportation Access

**Road Access:**
- Is there a paved road to/near the site?
- If unpaved, what is the condition? (passable year-round?)
- Distance from main road to site entrance?
- Can trucks/heavy vehicles access for material delivery?
- Parking availability for staff and visitors?

**Public Transportation:**
- Distance to nearest bus/train station?
- Frequency of public transport service?
- Practical for daily commutes?

**Alternative Access:**
- Accessibility by foot or bike?
- Emergency vehicle access?
- Access during rainy season or winter?

### Step 2: Assess Utilities Availability

**Electricity:**
- Grid connection available at or near site?
- Distance to nearest power line?
- Connection costs (if not already available)?
- Power reliability in the area?
- Need for backup generator?
- Solar power as alternative → [[21_Technology_Integration|Technology Integration]]

**Water:**
- Municipal water supply available?
- Well drilling required?
- Distance to nearest water source?
- Water quality testing needed?
- Rainwater harvesting potential (roof area, annual rainfall) → [[21_Technology_Integration|Technology]]

**Bootstrap Model Water Strategy:**
- Primary: Rainwater harvesting (IBC tanks, €500-2k)
- Secondary: Well drilling if groundwater accessible (€1-5k)
- Tertiary: Municipal connection if available nearby
- Avoid: Atmospheric water generation (expensive, energy-intensive)

**Internet/Communications:**
- Mobile signal strength?
- Internet service provider availability?
- Need for satellite internet?
- Communication reliability?

### Step 3: Evaluate Accommodation Options

**On-Site Accommodation:**
- Possibility to build staff housing?
- Regulations around temporary/permanent structures?
- Cost to build basic facilities?
- Security considerations?

**Nearby Accommodation:**
- Distance to nearest town/village?
- Available hotels, guesthouses, rentals?
- Cost and quality of accommodation?
- Long-term rental feasibility for staff?
- Visitor accommodation for eco-tourism potential?

**Camping/Temporary:**
- Possibility for temporary camping?
- Facilities needed (bathroom, kitchen)?
- Seasonal feasibility?
- Safety and security?

### Step 4: Assess Material and Equipment Logistics

**Material Delivery:**
- Can suppliers deliver to site?
- Need for transshipment point?
- Storage facilities on-site or nearby?
- Security for materials and equipment?

**Equipment Access:**
- Can large equipment reach site? (tractors, trucks)
- Need for specialized vehicles (4WD)?
- Equipment rental availability locally?
- Fuel supply for vehicles and equipment?

### Step 5: Consider Visitor and Partner Access

**Stakeholder Visits:**
- How easily can funders visit?
- Partner organization access?
- Research institution visits?
- Media and press accessibility?

**Community Engagement:**
- Local community proximity?
- Community members can reach site easily?
- School groups for educational visits?

**Eco-Tourism Potential:**
- Attractive for visitors?
- Safe and manageable access?
- Proximity to tourist routes?
- Accommodation and facilities nearby?

## ⚠️ Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1: Remote Location**
- Problem: Site is ideal ecologically but very isolated
- Solution: Calculate true cost of accessibility improvements vs. choosing more accessible site. Consider phased access improvements.

**Challenge 2: Seasonal Access**
- Problem: Roads impassable during rainy season
- Solution: Plan operations around seasonal constraints, invest in 4WD vehicles, create all-weather access routes in Phase 1

**Challenge 3: No Grid Electricity**
- Problem: No power connection, extension costs prohibitive
- Solution: Full solar installation with battery storage. Calculate long-term cost vs. grid extension → [[21_Technology_Integration|Technology]]

**Challenge 4: Limited Accommodation**
- Problem: Nearest accommodation 2+ hours away
- Solution: Budget for on-site housing, consider RVs/mobile homes for initial phase, build permanent housing in later phases

**Challenge 5: High Logistics Costs**
- Problem: Delivery and transport costs are excessive
- Solution: Quantify actual costs vs. project budget. Consider bulk deliveries, local sourcing, or different site if costs unsustainable

## 💰 Cost Considerations

**One-Time Infrastructure:**
- Road improvements: €5,000-50,000 depending on scope
- Grid electricity connection: €3,000-30,000 depending on distance
- Well drilling: €3,000-15,000
- On-site accommodation: €30,000-100,000+ per building
- Internet installation: €500-5,000

**Ongoing Operational:**
- Staff transportation: €200-500/month per staff
- Material delivery surcharges: 10-30% premium for remote sites
- Utility costs: Variable by location
- Vehicle fuel and maintenance: €300-1,000/month
- Accommodation costs: €500-1,500/month per staff if renting

**Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
- Calculate total 5-year accessibility costs
- Compare to alternative sites
- Factor into [[32_Funding_Strategy|Funding Strategy]]
- Include in [[30_Business_Model|Business Model]] projections

## 📊 Accessibility Scoring Matrix

Create a simple scoring system (1-5) for each site:

| Factor | Weight | Site A | Site B | Site C |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Road Access | 4x | ___ | ___ | ___ |
| Electricity | 3x | ___ | ___ | ___ |
| Water | 3x | ___ | ___ | ___ |
| Accommodation | 2x | ___ | ___ | ___ |
| Internet | 2x | ___ | ___ | ___ |
| Logistics | 3x | ___ | ___ | ___ |
| **Total** | | | | |

Multiply each score by its weight for weighted comparison.
