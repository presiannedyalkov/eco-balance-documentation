## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify all applicable regulations and permits
- Understand environmental protection requirements
- Learn land use restrictions and zoning rules

## ⚠️ Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1: Information is Fragmented**
- Problem: Regulations spread across multiple agencies, hard to find complete picture
- Solution: Hire local expert who knows the system. Attend public information sessions. Join local NGO network for knowledge sharing.

**Challenge 2: Language Barriers**
- Problem: Regulations only available in local language
- Solution: Engage translator or bilingual consultant. Partner with local NGO. Hire local team member with regulatory knowledge.

**Challenge 3: Conflicting Requirements**
- Problem: Different agencies have contradictory requirements
- Solution: Document conflicts, request written clarification, escalate to coordinating authority, involve legal advisor.

**Challenge 4: Lengthy Approval Processes**
- Problem: Permits take 6-18 months
- Solution: Start early, factor into timeline, consider phased approach where some activities can start while awaiting permits for others.

**Challenge 5: Costs Higher Than Expected**
- Problem: Permit fees, assessments, legal costs exceed budget
- Solution: Get detailed cost estimates upfront, include 20% buffer, consider if site is still viable, adjust [[../../32_Funding_Strategy|funding plan]].

**Challenge 6: Protected Area Complications**
- Problem: Site in or near protected area with complex restrictions
- Solution: Work with environmental authority, may need to modify plans, could be opportunity (funding for conservation work), ensure full compliance.
