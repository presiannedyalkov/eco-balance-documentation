# Step 3: Estimate Restoration Potential

← Back to [[00_Site_Selection_Overview|Site Selection Overview]]

## Purpose
Calculate feasibility, cost, timeline, and success probability for each potential site.

## Assessment Framework

### 1. Restoration Difficulty Rating

**Level 1 - Low Difficulty:**
- Moderate degradation only
- Good soil structure retained
- Native seed sources present
- Natural regeneration possible
- Timeline: 5-10 years
- Cost: €5,000-10,000/hectare

**Level 2 - Medium Difficulty:**
- Significant degradation
- Soil needs improvement
- Some invasives present
- Active restoration required
- Timeline: 10-20 years  
- Cost: €10,000-20,000/hectare

**Level 3 - High Difficulty:**
- Severe degradation
- Soil heavily compacted or eroded
- Extensive invasives
- Major interventions needed
- Timeline: 20-30+ years
- Cost: €20,000-40,000+/hectare

### 2. Success Probability Factors

**High Probability (>80%):**
- Suitable climate for target ecosystem
- Reversible degradation
- Local community support
- Water available
- No major contamination

**Medium Probability (50-80%):**
- Climate marginally suitable
- Challenging but manageable degradation
- Neutral community stance
- Water management needed
- Minor remediation required

**Low Probability (<50%):**
- Climate incompatible
- Irreversible damage
- Community opposition
- Severe water scarcity
- Serious contamination

### 3. Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Benefits (quantify where possible):**
- Carbon sequestration (tons CO2)
- Biodiversity increase (species)
- Soil improvement (hectares)
- Water retention (liters)
- Community employment (jobs)
- Education value (visitors)

**Costs:**
- Land acquisition
- Site preparation
- Planting materials
- Infrastructure
- Labor (Years 1-5)
- Long-term management
- Monitoring

**Calculate:**
- Cost per unit benefit (€/ton CO2, €/species)
- Break-even timeline
- Return on investment metrics

### 4. Timeline Estimation

**Milestones:**
- Year 1: Site prep and initial planting
- Year 3: Survival >60%, visible progress
- Year 5: Established vegetation, self-maintenance begins
- Year 10: Mature ecosystem functions
- Year 20+: Fully self-sustaining

### 5. Risk Assessment

**Major risks:**
- Climate extremes (drought, fire)
- Funding shortfalls
- Community opposition
- Regulatory barriers
- Ecological failure

**Mitigation:**
- Identify for each risk
- Cost of mitigation
- Residual risk level
