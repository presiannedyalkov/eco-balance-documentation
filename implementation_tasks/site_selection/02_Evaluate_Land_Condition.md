# Step 2: Evaluate Land Condition

← Back to [[00_Site_Selection_Overview|Site Selection Overview]]

## Purpose  
Conduct thorough on-site assessment of land degradation and restoration opportunity.

## Process

### 1. Plan Site Visits
- Schedule visits to identified regions
- Arrange expert participation (ecologist, soil scientist)
- Prepare assessment checklists
- Coordinate with local contacts

### 2. Soil Assessment
**Field testing:**
- Visual inspection (color, texture, structure)
- Simple infiltration test
- Collect samples for lab analysis
- Document compaction and erosion

**Lab analysis:**
- pH, NPK levels
- Organic matter content
- Microbial activity
- Contamination screening

### 3. Vegetation Survey
- Document existing plant species
- Identify invasives vs natives
- Assess coverage and health
- Note remnant habitat patches
- Photo documentation

### 4. Water Availability
- Identify natural water sources
- Assess seasonal patterns
- Test water quality if present
- Evaluate groundwater depth
- Check rainfall data

### 5. Topography & Microclimate
- Note slopes and aspects
- Identify erosion risk areas
- Document sun exposure patterns
- Wind exposure assessment
- Frost pocket identification

### 6. Hazards & Constraints
- Contamination signs
- Unstable slopes
- Flooding risk
- Access limitations
- Adjacent land uses (incompatible activities)

### 7. Biodiversity Baseline
- Wildlife signs and observations
- Bird surveys
- Insect diversity
- Remnant species of value
- Connectivity to natural areas

## Documentation
- Completed assessment forms
- Soil test results
- Photo library (georeferenced)
- Species lists
- Site maps with notes

## Resources
- Field assessment team (2-4 people)
- Soil testing kit
- Camera, GPS
- Plant ID guides
- €500-1,500 per site visit (Bootstrap approach: founders conducting assessment, minimal lab tests)
- 2-3 days per site

**Bootstrap Model Note:**
For the v2.0 Bootstrap Model (1 hectare pilot, €20-30k Year 1 total budget), founders conduct site assessments with expert consultation as needed. This reduces costs compared to hiring full professional teams for multiple large site evaluations.

## Success Criteria
✅ Comprehensive data collected for each site  
✅ Expert assessments completed  
✅ Hazards identified  
✅ Baseline conditions documented  
✅ Comparison possible between sites
