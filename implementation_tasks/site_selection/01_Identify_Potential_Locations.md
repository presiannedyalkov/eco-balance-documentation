# Step 1: Identify Potential Locations

← Back to [[00_Site_Selection_Overview|Site Selection Overview]]

## Purpose
Conduct desktop research to identify promising regions and sites across Southern Europe that match restoration goals.

## Process

### 1. Define Search Criteria
**Climate:**
- Mediterranean or transitional climate zones
- Suitable temperature and rainfall for target ecosystems
- Consider climate change projections

**Geography:**
- Southern Europe focus (Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Southern France)
- Proximity to existing natural areas
- Watershed or landscape-scale opportunities

**Degradation Type:**
- Deforested or degraded lands
- Eroded or compacted soil
- Water-stressed areas
- Loss of biodiversity

### 2. Use Mapping Tools
- Google Earth / satellite imagery
- Regional environmental databases
- Land use maps
- Climate data (WorldClim, etc.)
- Protected area databases

### 3. Identify Candidate Regions
Create list of 10-20 potential regions based on:
- Environmental match to criteria
- Strategic geographic distribution
- Known degradation issues
- Existing conservation interest

### 4. Research Each Region
**Environmental:**
- Native ecosystems historically present
- Current state of degradation
- Existing protected areas nearby
- Water bodies and sources

**Social:**
- Population density and communities
- Land use patterns
- Economic activities
- Cultural significance

**Accessibility:**
- Major roads and transport
- Nearest cities/towns
- Infrastructure availability

### 5. Initial Screening
Narrow to 5-8 most promising regions for deeper investigation.

## Resources
- Internet and GIS tools
- Climate databases
- Regional planning documents
- Conservation organization contacts
- 20-40 hours research time

## Success Criteria
✅ 5-8 promising regions identified  
✅ Basic environmental data compiled  
✅ Geographic diversity across Southern Europe  
✅ Clear rationale for each selection
