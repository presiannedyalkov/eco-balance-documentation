# Step 1: Identify Potential Locations

← Back to [[00_Site_Selection_Overview|Site Selection Overview]]

## Purpose
Conduct desktop research to identify promising regions and sites across Germany that match restoration goals and Bootstrap Model requirements.

## Process

### 1. Define Search Criteria

**Climate:**
- Temperate oceanic/continental climate zones (Köppen: Cfb/Dfb)
- Annual rainfall 600-800mm with seasonal variation
- 4 distinct seasons with cold winters
- Consider climate change adaptation (increasing drought resilience)

**Geography:**
- **Germany focus:** Priority regions within 100-200km of major cities (Frankfurt, Berlin, Munich)
- **Target states:** Brandenburg, Saxony, Rhineland-Palatinate, Lower Saxony
- Proximity to existing natural areas and conservation zones
- Watershed or landscape-scale opportunities
- Accessibility for Bootstrap operations (founders can reach site regularly)

**Degradation Type:**
- Former agricultural land (abandoned or degraded farmland)
- Depleted forest areas needing restoration
- Post-industrial sites suitable for rewilding
- Eroded or compacted soil from intensive agriculture
- Areas with reduced biodiversity

### 2. Use Mapping Tools

**Germany-Specific Resources:**
- Google Earth / satellite imagery
- **German Climate Atlas** (Deutscher Klimaatlas): climate projections
- **ATKIS/DLM**: German topographic and land use data
- **OpenStreetMap Germany**: Detailed infrastructure mapping
- **Bundesamt für Naturschutz (BfN)**: Protected area databases
- State forestry agency maps (Landesforstämter)
- Agricultural land registries (by state)

### 3. Identify Candidate Regions

Create list of 10-15 potential regions in Germany based on:
- Environmental match to temperate restoration criteria
- Geographic distribution across target German states
- Known land degradation or abandonment issues
- Existing conservation interest or proximity to protected areas
- Bootstrap accessibility (within reasonable distance for founders)
- Land availability and affordability (€10-20k/hectare range)

**Priority Search Areas:**
- **Brandenburg:** Affordable land, former agricultural areas, rewilding opportunities
- **Saxony:** Post-mining restoration potential, forest regeneration
- **Rhineland-Palatinate:** Mixed forest restoration, river valley opportunities
- **Lower Saxony:** Wetland restoration, agricultural transition zones

### 4. Research Each Region

**Environmental:**
- **Native ecosystems:** German mixed deciduous forests (beech, oak), wetlands, heathlands
- **Historical ecology:** Pre-agricultural landscape composition
- Current state of degradation and causes
- Existing protected areas nearby (Naturschutzgebiete, FFH-Gebiete)
- Water bodies, groundwater, and watershed health
- **Target species:** Native German flora (Fagus sylvatica, Quercus robur, Pinus sylvestris, etc.)

**Social:**
- Population density and nearest communities
- Land use patterns and ownership structure
- Economic activities (agriculture, forestry, tourism)
- Cultural significance and local attitudes to rewilding
- Community relationship with nature conservation

**Legal/Regulatory:**
- **Federal laws:** Bundesnaturschutzgesetz (Federal Nature Conservation Act)
- **State regulations:** Landeswaldgesetze (State Forest Laws)
- Land use planning (Flächennutzungsplan)
- Building/development restrictions
- Environmental protection requirements

**Accessibility:**
- Major roads (Autobahn/Bundesstraße access)
- Nearest towns with services (< 30km ideal)
- Internet availability (for off-grid work)
- Emergency services access

### 5. Initial Screening
Narrow to 5-8 most promising regions for deeper investigation.

## Resources

**Desktop Research Tools:**
- Internet and GIS tools
- German Climate Atlas (Deutscher Klimaatlas)
- Bundesamt für Naturschutz (BfN) databases
- State environmental agency websites
- Regional planning documents (Regionalplanung)
- Real estate portals (ImmobilienScout24, etc.)

**Organizations to Contact:**
- **NABU Deutschland** (German nature conservation organization)
- **Bundesamt für Naturschutz** (Federal Agency for Nature Conservation)
- State forestry agencies (Landesforstämter)
- Local conservation groups (Naturschutzvereine)
- University ecology/forestry departments

**Estimated Time:** 20-40 hours research time

## Success Criteria
✅ 5-8 promising regions identified in Germany
✅ Basic environmental data compiled for each region
✅ Geographic diversity across target German states
✅ Clear rationale for each selection based on Bootstrap criteria
✅ Preliminary land availability and cost assessment
✅ Understanding of German regulatory requirements
