## 📋 Purpose

Rainwater harvesting is one of the most sustainable and cost-effective water management strategies for restoration sites. By capturing precipitation that would otherwise run off, you can supplement irrigation needs, reduce erosion, recharge groundwater, and build water security. This task covers both active harvesting (capturing water from surfaces for storage) and passive harvesting (slowing and spreading water across the landscape) to maximize every drop that falls on your site.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Capture rainwater from roofs, hard surfaces, and landscape
- Reduce stormwater runoff and erosion
- Provide supplemental water for irrigation during dry periods
- Recharge groundwater through infiltration
- Reduce dependence on external water sources
- Create climate-resilient water supply
- Demonstrate sustainable water practices
- Lower water costs and environmental impact

## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Understand Rainwater Harvesting Types

**Active harvesting (collection and storage):**
- Roof catchment systems → gutters → storage tanks/cisterns
- Hard surface collection → filters → storage
- Best for: Immediate water needs, irrigation, supplemental supply
- Requires: Infrastructure investment, maintenance
- Yields: High volume from concentrated surfaces

**Passive harvesting (landscape-based infiltration):**
- Swales, berms, and basins that slow and sink water
- Contouring landscape to capture and spread runoff
- Best for: Groundwater recharge, erosion control, long-term soil moisture
- Requires: Earthwork, minimal maintenance
- Yields: Enhanced soil moisture, reduced runoff

**Hybrid approach (recommended):**
- Combine both for maximum benefit
- Active for immediate needs, passive for soil building
- Complimentary strategies that support each other
- Resilience through diversity

### Step 2: Calculate Rainwater Harvesting Potential

**Basic formula:**
**Catchment Area (sq ft) × Rainfall (inches) × 0.623 = Gallons captured**

(Accounting for ~10% loss to evaporation and spillage)

**Example calculations:**

**Roof catchment:**
- Building: 2,000 sq ft roof
- Annual rainfall: 20 inches
- Potential: 2,000 × 20 × 0.623 = 24,920 gallons/year
- Per inch of rain: 2,000 × 0.623 = 1,246 gallons

**Hard surface catchment:**
- Parking/driveway: 5,000 sq ft
- Annual rainfall: 20 inches
- Potential: 5,000 × 20 × 0.623 = 62,300 gallons/year

**Passive landscape catchment:**
- Swale catchment area: 1 acre (43,560 sq ft)
- Annual rainfall: 20 inches
- Runoff captured: 43,560 × 20 × 0.623 = 542,556 gallons/year
- (Note: This infiltrates rather than stores for direct use)

**Determine realistic capture percentage:**
- Well-designed system: 75-90% of potential
- Basic system: 50-75% of potential
- Account for overflow, losses, and maintenance downtime

### Step 3: Design Active Roof Catchment System

**Components needed:**

**1. Collection surface (roof):**
- Material considerations: Metal best, asphalt shingles acceptable, avoid treated wood
- Clean surface without debris or contamination
- Sloped for drainage
- Area determines potential volume

**2. Gutters and downspouts:**
- Sized for peak rainfall intensity
- Minimum 5-inch gutters for most applications
- 3×4 inch downspouts standard
- Secure installation to handle storm flows
- Leaf guards to reduce debris

**3. First-flush diverter:**
- Diverts initial dirty water (bird droppings, dust, debris)
- First 10 gallons per 1,000 sq ft roof discarded
- Automatic or manual reset
- Critical for water quality

**4. Filtration:**
- Screen filter (200 micron or finer) for debris
- Optional sand or charcoal filters for higher quality
- Inline filters before storage
- Regular cleaning essential

**5. Storage (see [[03_Build_Water_Storage_Structures|Build Water Storage Structures]]):**
- Tanks, cisterns, or ponds
- Size based on supply and demand analysis
- Covered to prevent algae, mosquitoes, evaporation
- Overflow system back to landscape

**6. Distribution system:**
- Gravity-fed if possible (elevate tanks)
- Pump if needed for pressure
- Drip irrigation or hose bibs
- Backflow prevention if connecting to any potable system

**Design considerations:**
- Place tanks near collection points (minimize piping)
- Access for maintenance
- Foundation/pad for stability
- Freeze protection in cold climates
- Overflow directed to infiltration areas

### Step 4: Design Passive Landscape Harvesting

**Swales (vegetated infiltration trenches):**
- **Location:** On contour (level along slope)
- **Dimensions:** 
  - Width: 3-10 feet depending on site
  - Depth: 6-18 inches
  - Length: Along contour
  - Berm on downslope side: 6-12 inches high
- **Spacing:** Every 20-50 feet of vertical elevation
- **Function:** Capture runoff, slow water, allow infiltration
- **Vegetation:** Deep-rooted plants enhance infiltration

**Berms:**
- **Purpose:** Direct water to desired locations
- **Height:** 6-18 inches
- **Width:** 2-4 feet at base
- **Location:** Along contours, around basins
- **Combination:** Often paired with swales

**Rain gardens/infiltration basins:**
- **Size:** 10-20% of contributing drainage area
- **Depth:** 6-12 inches
- **Location:** Low points that naturally collect water
- **Soil:** Amended for good drainage if needed
- **Plants:** Water-tolerant species that can handle both wet and dry

**Terracing:**
- **Application:** Steep slopes
- **Benefit:** Creates level planting areas, slows runoff
- **Construction:** Cut and fill to create steps
- **Combination:** With berms and swales for maximum effect

**Design process:**
1. Map water flow patterns (observe in rain)
2. Identify high-volume runoff areas
3. Design systems to intercept before leaving site
4. Create overflow paths for extreme events
5. Integrate with planting design

### Step 5: Implement Hard Surface Catchment

**Paved areas (driveways, parking, paths):**
- **Grade toward:** Vegetated areas not storm drains
- **Channel with:** Curbs or berms to infiltration basins
- **Break up large areas:** Create infiltration pockets
- **Permeable paving:** Consider for new construction

**Roof runoff from outbuildings:**
- Don't need full cistern systems for every building
- Direct to rain gardens or swales
- Rain chains as attractive alternatives to downspouts
- Splash blocks to prevent erosion

**Collection at downspouts:**
- Rain barrels (50-100 gallons) for small-scale
- Daisy-chain multiple barrels
- Overflow to infiltration areas
- Mosquito screens essential

- Beauty and function combined

**Maintain Consistently**
- Set reminders for seasonal tasks
- Small problems become big if ignored
- Clean systems work better
- Extend system life with care

**Plan for Overflow**
- Every system will overflow eventually
- Direct overflow beneficially (infiltration areas)
- Never create erosion problems
- Design for 100-year storm

**Consider Water Quality Needs**
- Irrigation: Minimal treatment needed
- Landscape infiltration: None needed
- Potable use: Requires extensive treatment (not covered here)

## 💧 System Sizing Guidelines

**Basic sizing approach:**
1. Calculate peak monthly irrigation deficit (from [[01_Assess_Water_Needs|Water Assessment]])
2. Determine rainfall during that month
3. Storage = Deficit minus same-month rain
4. Add 20% buffer for dry spells

**Example:**
- Peak deficit: July needs 3 inches over 2 acres = 163,000 gallons
- July rainfall: Typically zero
- Prior months surplus: Wet season fills storage
- Storage needed: ~5,000-10,000 gallons for critical plants
- Full 163,000 gallons impractical; prioritize high-value areas

**Rule of thumb:**
- Basic system: 500-1,000 gallons per roof
- Comprehensive system: 1,000-2,000 gallons per 1,000 sq ft roof
- Commercial scale: 5,000-50,000 gallons
- Passive systems: Size to handle peak storm (not seasonal storage)

## 🚀 Getting Started

Ready to harvest rainwater? Follow this sequence:

1. **Review water needs assessment** to understand irrigation deficit
2. **Calculate harvesting potential** for your site
3. **Design appropriate system** (active, passive, or both)
4. **Start with passive systems** for cost-effectiveness
5. **Add active systems** where high-value storage needed
