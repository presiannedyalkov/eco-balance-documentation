## 📋 Purpose

Drought is an inevitable challenge in restoration, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions and with increasing climate variability. Effective drought management combines proactive strategies to reduce vulnerability, tactical responses during dry periods, and recovery planning for post-drought resilience. Rather than fighting drought, this approach works with natural cycles to build water-wise, climate-adapted restoration systems that can survive and even thrive during extended dry periods.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build drought resilience through site design and species selection
- Reduce water needs through multiple strategies
- Respond effectively when drought occurs
- Minimize plant loss during extreme dry periods
- Recover quickly after drought ends
- Adapt management based on drought experience
- Create self-sustaining systems less dependent on supplemental water
- Demonstrate climate-smart restoration practices

## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Understand Drought Risk

**Assess local drought patterns:**
- Historical drought frequency (decades or centuries)
- Typical drought duration (months or years)
- Severity ranges (moderate to extreme)
- Seasonal patterns (summer drought vs. year-round)
- Recent trends and climate projections

**Classify your drought context:**
- **Annual summer drought:** Mediterranean climates, predictable
- **Periodic multi-year drought:** Cycles every 5-15 years
- **Unpredictable drought:** Variable timing and intensity
- **Chronic water limitation:** Arid lands, permanent water stress

**Determine vulnerability:**
- Site water-holding capacity
- Plant water requirements
- Existing water storage
- Irrigation capacity and reliability
- Recovery potential after drought

### Step 2: Design for Drought Resilience (Proactive)

**Site-level strategies:**

**Maximize water capture and retention:**
- Implement all [[02_Rainwater_Harvesting|rainwater harvesting]] strategies
- Build adequate [[03_Build_Water_Storage_Structures|water storage]]
- Create swales and berms to slow and sink water
- Increase soil organic matter (each 1% holds 20,000+ gal/acre)
- Mulch all bare soil to reduce evaporation
- Contour planting on slopes to capture runoff

**Reduce water demand:**
- Select drought-adapted native species as priority
- Group plants by water needs (hydrozoning)
- Reduce total planted area if water-limited
- Space plants wider initially
- Avoid water-demanding species unless essential
- Plan for natural attrition during establishment

**Create microclimates:**
- North-facing slopes retain more moisture
- Sheltered areas protected from drying winds
- Shade structures reduce evapotranspiration
- Nurse plants provide microclimate for others
- Rock mulches create cooler root zones

**Improve soil water efficiency:**
- Deep, well-structured soil holds more water
- Follow all [[../soil_restoration/00_Soil_Restoration_Overview|soil restoration]] practices
- Mycorrhizal fungi extend water access
- Reduce compaction for better infiltration
- Clay soils hold water better than sand

### Step 3: Select Drought-Tolerant Species

**Characteristics of drought-tolerant plants:**
- Deep root systems
- Small or waxy leaves
- Native to your region
- Evolved for local rainfall patterns
- Able to go dormant during stress
- Rapid recovery after rain

**Species selection strategy:**
- **Backbone (60-80%):** Highly drought-tolerant natives
- **Supporting (15-30%):** Moderately drought-tolerant
- **Accent (5-10%):** May need occasional water during extreme drought

**Avoid drought-vulnerable species:**
- Thirsty exotics
- Shallow-rooted plants
- Species from wetter climates
- High-maintenance ornamentals

**Examples by region:**
- **Southwest US:** Acacia, mesquite, palo verde, agave, yucca
- **California:** Coast live oak, manzanita, ceanothus, sage species
- **Great Plains:** Buffalo grass, prairie plants, native grasses
- **Mediterranean:** Olive, rosemary, lavender, native oaks
- Research species native to your specific area

### Step 4: Establish Strong Root Systems

**Planting for drought resistance:**
- Plant in fall or early spring (before heat/drought)
- Use larger containers (better root development)
- Scarify root balls to encourage outward growth
- Plant in prepared, amended soil
- Water deeply at planting

**Irrigation during establishment:**
- Deep, infrequent watering encourages deep roots
- Gradually extend time between watering
- "Train" plants to be drought-tolerant from start
- Avoid constant shallow watering (weak roots)
- Reduce irrigation steadily each year

**Timeline for independence:**
- Year 1: Regular irrigation (2-3x per week)
- Year 2: Reduced irrigation (1-2x per week)
- Year 3: Occasional irrigation (monthly or as needed)
- Year 4+: Emergency only or none

### Step 5: Implement Water-Saving Practices

**Mulching (critical for drought management):**
- 3-6 inch layer around all plants
- Organic mulch: wood chips, leaves, straw
- Reduces evaporation by 50-70%
- Moderates soil temperature
- Builds soil as it decomposes
- Replenish annually

**Eliminate water waste:**
- Fix all leaks immediately
- Optimize [[04_Efficient_Irrigation|irrigation efficiency]]
- No watering during rain or high wind
- Avoid runoff by adjusting rates
- Target root zones, not foliage

**Reduce competition:**
- Aggressive weed control (weeds steal water)
- Remove invasive species
- Thin overcrowded plantings
- Prioritize high-value plants

**Protect soil moisture:**
- Minimize soil disturbance (preserves structure)
- Keep soil covered year-round
- Windbreaks reduce evapotranspiration
- Shade cloth for extreme heat (temporary)

### Step 6: Monitor for Drought Onset

**Establish monitoring system:**
- Track rainfall (compare to historical average)
- Monitor soil moisture regularly
- Observe plant stress indicators
- Track weather forecasts and drought maps
- Note reservoir and stream levels

**Drought indicators:**
- Rainfall below 75% of normal for season
- Soil dry below 6 inches despite recent rain
- Plants wilting during coolest parts of day
- Early leaf drop or dormancy
- Regional drought declarations

**Drought stages:**
- **Mild (D0-D1):** Below average precipitation
- **Moderate (D2):** Some impacts, voluntary conservation
- **Severe (D3):** Mandatory restrictions, significant impacts
- **Extreme (D4):** Major losses, emergency measures
- **Exceptional (D5):** Exceptional and widespread losses

**Early warning systems:**
- US Drought Monitor (droughtmonitor.unl.edu)
- Local water district alerts
- Weather service drought forecasts
- Seasonal climate predictions

### Step 7: Respond During Drought (Reactive)

**Immediate actions when drought confirmed:**

**Prioritize plants:**
- **Critical:** Rare species, expensive trees, demonstration areas
- **Important:** Established restoration plantings
- **Acceptable loss:** Drought-adapted species, mature natives

**Adjust irrigation:**
- Focus limited water on priority plants only
- Deep, less frequent watering
- Water in early morning only
- Use greywater if available and legal
- Hand water high-priority individuals

**Stress reduction:**
- Apply/refresh mulch immediately
- Prune dead wood only (no growth pruning)
- Remove flowers/fruit to conserve energy
- Install temporary shade structures
- Reduce foot traffic and disturbance

**Water conservation:**
- Stop all non-essential watering
- Repair any leaks immediately
- Eliminate irrigation system testing/flushing
- Capture all available water sources
- Consider water hauling for critical plants

**Active management:**
- Remove severely stressed plants (they won't recover)
- Thin plantings to reduce competition
- Control weeds aggressively
- Reduce mulch around plants if encouraging rodents

### Step 8: Accept and Document Losses

**Realistic expectations:**
- Some plant loss inevitable in severe drought
- Natural selection for most drought-tolerant individuals
- Opportunity to learn about species performance
- Part of restoration process

**Documentation:**
- Photograph stressed and lost plants
- Record species, location, size
- Note which species survived vs. failed
- Track water availability and use
- Document management actions taken

**Learn from losses:**
- Which species most vulnerable?
- Did site conditions affect survival?
- Were some areas more resilient?
- What management actions helped?
- How can future plantings be improved?

### Step 9: Recover After Drought

**Post-drought assessment:**
- Survey all plants for survival and condition
- Identify dead plants for removal/replacement
- Note recovery rates by species
- Evaluate infrastructure damage (irrigation, etc.)
- Document lessons learned

**Recovery actions:**

**Immediate (first good rain):**
- Deep water recovering plants
- Do not fertilize (wait for full recovery)
- Remove dead plants that won't recover
- Repair damaged infrastructure

**Short-term (first season after):**
- Replace lost plants with more drought-tolerant species
- Expand mulch layers
- Improve water harvesting based on lessons
- Increase storage if inadequate
- Update species palette

**Long-term (1-2 years after):**
- Monitor recovery progress
- Adjust overall strategy
- Invest in resilience improvements
- Update drought management plan
- Celebrate survival and adaptation

### Step 10: Build Adaptive Capacity

**Learn and improve:**
- After each drought, update your plan
- Incorporate lessons into design
- Increase resilience incrementally
- Share knowledge with restoration community

**Adaptive strategies:**
- Shift species mix toward more drought-tolerant
- Increase water storage capacity
