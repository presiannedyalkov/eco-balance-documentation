## 📋 Purpose

While the goal of restoration is to create self-sustaining ecosystems that ultimately require minimal irrigation, supplemental water is often necessary during establishment and in water-limited environments. Efficient irrigation ensures every drop counts by delivering water precisely where and when needed, minimizing waste through evaporation, runoff, and overwatering. This task focuses on selecting, installing, and managing irrigation systems that support restoration while conserving precious water resources.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Deliver water efficiently to plant root zones
- Minimize water loss through evaporation and runoff
- Reduce labor requirements through automation
- Support plant establishment during critical periods
- Gradually reduce irrigation as plants mature
- Monitor and optimize water use
- Achieve restoration goals with minimal water waste
- Build toward eventual irrigation independence

## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Assess Irrigation Needs

**Review water assessment:**
- Refer to [[01_Assess_Water_Needs|Assess Water Needs]]
- Identify areas requiring supplemental water
- Determine irrigation duration (establishment only vs. ongoing)
- Calculate peak demand periods

**Zone the site:**
- **High priority:** Rare species, expensive plantings, demonstration areas
- **Medium priority:** Standard restoration plantings
- **Low priority:** Drought-adapted species, mature plants
- **No irrigation:** Native species after establishment

**Establish irrigation goals:**
- Short-term: Support establishment (years 1-3)
- Medium-term: Drought assistance only (years 3-5)
- Long-term: Minimal or no irrigation (year 5+)

### Step 2: Choose Appropriate Irrigation Method

**Drip irrigation (most efficient - recommended):**
- **Efficiency:** 85-95%
- **Method:** Delivers water slowly directly to root zone
- **Best for:** Individual plants, rows, gardens, most restoration
- **Advantages:** Minimal evaporation, no runoff, targets roots, reduces weeds
- **Disadvantages:** Requires filtration, can clog, initial cost, maintenance
- **Components:** Mainline, laterals, emitters, filters, pressure regulator

**Micro-sprayers:**
- **Efficiency:** 75-85%
- **Method:** Small spray patterns around plants
- **Best for:** Shrubs, grouped plantings, areas needing coverage
- **Advantages:** Waters multiple plants, adjustable patterns
- **Disadvantages:** More evaporation than drip, wind affects pattern

**Soaker hoses:**
- **Efficiency:** 70-80%
- **Method:** Porous hose weeps water along length
- **Best for:** Rows, hedges, simple layouts
- **Advantages:** Inexpensive, easy to install, flexible
- **Disadvantages:** Uneven distribution, shorter lifespan, hard to monitor

**Overhead sprinklers:**
- **Efficiency:** 50-70%
- **Method:** Throws water through air
- **Best for:** Turf, broadcast seeding, emergency only
- **Disadvantages:** High evaporation, promotes disease, weed germination, water waste
- **When acceptable:** Initial germination of seed mixes

**Hand watering:**
- **Efficiency:** Variable (often 30-50%)
- **Method:** Hose or watering can
- **Best for:** Small areas, individual care, supplementing other systems
- **Advantages:** Flexible, immediate response to plant needs
- **Disadvantages:** Labor intensive, inconsistent, often wastes water

**Recommendation hierarchy:**
1. Drip irrigation for most plantings
2. Micro-sprayers for shrub groupings
3. Soaker hoses for simple rows (budget option)
4. Hand watering for small scale only
5. Overhead sprinklers avoid if possible

### Step 3: Design the Irrigation System

**System layout planning:**

**1. Draw site map:**
- Mark all plants or planting areas
- Identify water source location
- Note elevation changes
- Mark access paths and obstacles

**2. Group into zones:**
- Similar water needs together
- Similar sun exposure together
- Similar plant types together
- Maximum area per zone based on flow rate

**3. Calculate water requirements per zone:**
- Plant water need × number of plants
- Convert to liters per hour or day
- Account for soil type and climate

**4. Size system components:**
- **Mainline:** Based on total flow, typically 20-40mm (3/4" to 1.5")
- **Lateral lines:** Based on zone flow, typically 13-20mm (1/2" to 3/4")
- **Emitters:** 2-8 liters per hour per plant typically
- **Filters:** Based on water source (screen or disk filters)
- **Pressure regulator:** Maintain 1-2 bar (15-30 PSI) for drip

**Drip system layout example:**
- Water source (tank or tap)
- Backflow preventer (if connecting to potable water)
- Filter (200 mesh minimum)
- Pressure regulator (0.7-1.7 bar or 10-25 PSI)
- Mainline to planting areas
- Valve for each zone
- Lateral lines with emitters
- End caps and flush valves

**Calculations needed:**
- Total flow rate (L/min) available from source
- Flow rate required per zone
- Number of emitters per zone
- Pipe sizing for flow rates
- Pressure loss in system

### Step 4: Select Components and Materials

**Mainline and laterals:**
- Polyethylene tubing (PE) standard
- 13-25mm (1/2" to 1") for most systems
- UV-resistant for above-ground installation
- Buried 5-15 cm for protection

**Emitters:**
- **Pressure-compensating:** Maintain even flow at varying pressures (recommended)
- **Non-compensating:** Cheaper, adequate for flat sites
- **Flow rates:** 2, 4, 8, 15 L/h common (0.5, 1, 2, 4 GPH)
- **Adjustable:** Allow fine-tuning per plant
- **Inline:** Built into tubing
- **On-line:** Individual insertion into tubing

**Fittings:**
- Compression fittings for mainline
- Barbed fittings for laterals
- Tees, elbows, couplings as needed
- End caps and flush valves

**Filtration:**
- Screen filter: Basic, easy to clean
- Disk filter: Better for fine particles
- 150-200 mesh for drip irrigation
- Larger for micro-sprayers

**Valves:**
- Manual ball valves (basic systems)
- Electric solenoid valves (automated systems)
- Anti-siphon valves (if required)
- Pressure-relief valves

**Controllers (optional but recommended):**
- Battery or AC powered
- Multi-zone capacity
- Timer-based programming
- Rain sensor input
- Wi-Fi enabled (advanced)

**Accessories:**
- Stakes to secure tubing
- Goof plugs to seal unused holes
- Tubing cutter
- Hole punch for emitter installation
- Teflon tape for threaded connections

### Step 5: Installation

**Preparation:**
- Lay out all materials before installation
- Mark planting locations
- Ensure water source adequate
- Clear paths for tubing runs

**Installation sequence:**

1. **Install water source components:**
   - Backflow preventer (if needed)
   - Filter
   - Pressure regulator
   - Main shutoff valve

2. **Run mainline:**
   - From source to planting areas
   - Bury or stake above ground
   - Install zone valves at key locations

3. **Install laterals:**
   - From mainline to plant rows/areas
   - Secure with stakes every 0.9-1.2 meters
   - Leave slack for expansion/contraction

4. **Add emitters:**
   - Punch holes in tubing at plant locations
   - Insert emitters (one per small plant, 2-4 per tree)
   - Position near but not touching stem

5. **Install end caps and flush valves:**
   - Cap all line ends
   - Flush valves at low points for maintenance

6. **Connect controller:**
   - Wire to zone valves
   - Program initial schedule
   - Add rain sensor if included

7. **Test system:**
   - Turn on each zone
   - Check for leaks
   - Verify even water distribution
   - Adjust emitter positions if needed
   - Fine-tune flow rates

**Above-ground vs. buried:**
- Above-ground: Easier maintenance, visible for adjustments
- Buried: Protected from damage, aesthetically better, trip hazard eliminated
- Hybrid: Mainline buried, laterals above ground

### Step 6: Program Watering Schedule

**Factors affecting schedule:**
- Plant water needs (species, age, size)
- Soil type (drainage, water holding capacity)
- Weather (temperature, wind, humidity, recent rain)
- Season (higher needs in summer)
- Growth stage (establishment vs. mature)

**Frequency vs. duration:**
- **Frequent, shallow:** Daily light watering for seeds/seedlings
- **Infrequent, deep:** 2-3 times/week deep watering for established plants
- Goal: Encourage deep root growth

**General guidelines:**
- Establishment phase (Year 1): 2-3 times per week, 1-2 hours per zone
- Year 2: Reduce to 1-2 times per week, same duration
- Year 3+: As needed during drought only, or eliminate

**Timing of day:**
- **Best:** Early morning (4-8 AM) - less evaporation, plants dry during day
- **Acceptable:** Evening (6-9 PM) - less evaporation, but leaves stay wet overnight
- **Avoid:** Midday - high evaporation loss

**Seasonal adjustments:**
- Spring: Moderate watering as plants grow
- Summer: Peak watering needs
- Fall: Reduce as temperatures drop
- Winter: Minimal or none (frost damage risk)

**Example schedule (drip system, Year 1):**
- Monday, Wednesday, Friday: 6 AM for 90 minutes
- Adjust based on rainfall and observation

### Step 7: Monitor and Adjust

**Regular observations:**
- Plant appearance (wilting, yellowing, vigor)
- Soil moisture (dig down 15-30 cm)
- System performance (leaks, clogs, even distribution)
- Weather patterns (adjust for rain, heat waves)

**Signs of under-watering:**
- Wilting during hottest part of day
- Leaf drop or browning
- Stunted growth
- Soil dry below surface

**Signs of over-watering:**
- Yellowing leaves
- Fungal growth
- Root rot symptoms
- Constantly wet soil surface
- Weed proliferation

**Adjustment strategies:**
- Change frequency or duration
- Add/remove emitters
- Modify zones for different needs
- Update controller programming
- Clean filters if flow reduced

**Maintenance tasks:**
- Weekly: Visual inspection, check for problems
- Monthly: Clean filters, check pressure
- Quarterly: Flush lines, verify even distribution
- Annually: Full system check, replace worn parts

### Step 8: Phase Out Irrigation

**Goal:** Restore self-sustaining ecosystem

**Year 1-2:** Full irrigation support
- Regular watering on schedule
- Monitor closely
- Establish root systems

**Year 3:** Reduce frequency
- Cut watering to half
- Extend intervals
- Water only during heat/drought

**Year 4-5:** Emergency only
- No regular schedule
- Respond to severe stress
- Most plants surviving on natural rainfall

**Year 5+:** Irrigation independence
- Remove or decommission system
- Native plants fully adapted
- Occasional hand watering for rare species only

**Success indicators:**
- Plants thriving with reduced water
- Deep root development
- Survival through dry periods
- Vigorous growth without irrigation
