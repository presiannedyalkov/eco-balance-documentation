← Back to [[README|Implementation Tasks]] | [[00_Water_Management_Overview|Water Management Overview]]

---

## 📋 Purpose

Monitoring water use is the feedback loop that transforms water management from guesswork into data-driven optimization. Without monitoring, you cannot know if your conservation strategies are working, whether you're over- or under-watering, or how to adjust practices for maximum efficiency. Effective water monitoring provides quantitative evidence of system performance, identifies waste and opportunities, validates sustainable practices, and demonstrates responsible stewardship to stakeholders. It's the essential practice that closes the loop on all other water management efforts.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Track total water consumption from all sources
- Measure effectiveness of conservation strategies
- Identify patterns, waste, and optimization opportunities
- Ensure water use aligns with availability and sustainability
- Detect leaks, inefficiencies, and system problems early
- Validate that plants receive adequate water
- Provide data for adaptive management decisions
- Document water stewardship for reporting and accountability
- Support continuous improvement of water practices

## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Establish Baseline Water Use

**Before implementing monitoring system, understand current state:**

**Calculate total annual water use:**
- Irrigation water (from wells, municipal, stored)
- Rainfall capture and use
- Water hauled or delivered
- Any other sources (greywater, recycled, etc.)

**Convert all measurements to consistent units:**
- Gallons, cubic meters, or acre-feet
- Track monthly and annually
- Include seasonal variations

**Document baseline conditions:**
- Total annual volume
- Water sources breakdown (%)
- Peak usage periods
- Cost per unit (if purchasing water)
- Efficiency metrics (gallons per plant, per acre, etc.)

**Example baseline data:**
```
Annual Water Use (Baseline - Year 1):
- Total: 250,000 gallons
- Municipal water: 180,000 gal (72%)
- Rainwater harvested: 50,000 gal (20%)
- Hauled water: 20,000 gal (8%)
- Average monthly: 20,833 gallons
- Peak month (July): 45,000 gallons
- Cost: €900 annually
- Per-acre use: 25,000 gal/acre
```

### Step 2: Install Water Meters

**Main supply metering:**

**Municipal water connections:**
- Main meter (utility company provides)
- Sub-meters for different zones if possible
- Location: After pressure regulator, before any splits
- Professional installation recommended
- Record meter number and location

**Well or pump systems:**
- Inline flow meter on pump discharge
- Digital meters provide best data
- Consider meters with data logging
- Installation: Between pump and pressure tank
- May need electrician for powered meters

**Water storage monitoring:**
- Tank level indicators (float switches, ultrasonic sensors)
- Visual gauges or dipsticks for small tanks
- Flow meters on tank outputs
- Recording both inflow and outflow

**Irrigation zone metering:**
- Sub-meters for each major irrigation zone
- Allows comparison of water use by area
- Identifies which zones use most water
- Helps detect zone-specific leaks or inefficiency

**Meter types:**
- **Mechanical:** Reliable, no power needed, less expensive (€50-200)
- **Digital:** More accurate, data logging, expensive (€200-1,000+)
- **Smart meters:** Remote monitoring, real-time data, highest cost (€500-2,000+)

**Installation tips:**
- Install where easily accessible for reading
- Protect from freezing (insulate or install below frost line)
- Install according to manufacturer specifications
- Consider bypass for maintenance
- Document all meter locations on site map

### Step 3: Install Soil Moisture Monitoring

**Why monitor soil moisture:**
- Direct measurement of plant-available water
- Prevents over- and under-watering
- Most accurate trigger for irrigation decisions
- Validates that water reaches root zone
- Reduces water waste significantly

**Soil moisture sensor types:**

**Tensiometers (€30-100 each):**
- Measure soil water tension (how hard plants work for water)
- Most accurate for irrigation timing
- Require maintenance (refilling)
- Best for frequent monitoring
- 12-36 inch depths available

**Electrical resistance sensors (€50-200):**
- Gypsum blocks or granular matrix sensors
- Long-term installation
- Lower maintenance
- Less accurate but adequate
- Good for budget monitoring

**Capacitance sensors (€100-500):**
- Measure soil dielectric constant
- Very accurate
- Multiple depths available
- Durable and reliable
- Can integrate with automated systems

**Time domain reflectometry (TDR) (€500-3,000):**
- Research-grade accuracy
- Expensive but precise
- Good for critical applications
- May be overkill for most projects

**Installation strategy:**
- Place sensors in representative locations
- Install at multiple depths (6", 12", 24")
- One sensor per major zone minimum
- More sensors in diverse or critical areas
- Avoid compacted soil or rocky areas

**Number of sensors needed:**
- Small site (<1 acre): 3-5 sensors
- Medium site (1-10 acres): 8-15 sensors
- Large site (>10 acres): 15-30+ sensors
- Critical/demonstration areas: Higher density

**Installation procedure:**
- Follow manufacturer instructions exactly
- Ensure good soil contact
- Install at appropriate depth for target plants
- Protect wires from damage (conduit, burial)
- Mark locations clearly
- Record GPS coordinates if large site

### Step 4: Establish Monitoring Schedule

**Create regular monitoring routine:**

**Daily (during active growing season):**
- Check soil moisture readings
- Observe plant stress indicators
- Note any irrigation system issues
- Record rainfall amounts

**Weekly:**
- Read all water meters
- Calculate weekly water use
- Download data from automated sensors (if equipped)
- Inspect for leaks or problems
- Compare to previous weeks

**Monthly:**
- Compile monthly water use totals
- Calculate monthly efficiency metrics
- Compare to baseline and targets
- Review trends and patterns
- Update monitoring logs

**Seasonal:**
- End-of-season water use summary
- Compare across seasons and years
- Evaluate effectiveness of conservation measures
- Identify areas for improvement
- Adjust strategies for next season

**Annual:**
- Comprehensive annual water audit
- Cost analysis (if purchasing water)
- Report to stakeholders
- Set goals for next year
- Update water management plan

**Assign monitoring responsibility:**
- Designate primary person responsible
- Train backup staff
- Create simple data collection forms
- Establish data entry procedures
- Set up reminders and alerts

### Step 5: Use Manual Monitoring Techniques

**Visual plant monitoring (no equipment needed):**

**Signs of adequate water:**
- Healthy leaf color and size
- Normal growth rate
- Turgid (firm) leaves and stems
- Flowering and fruiting on schedule

**Signs of water stress:**
- Wilting during heat of day
- Leaf curling or cupping
- Dull or grayish leaf color
- Stunted growth
- Premature leaf drop
- Reduced flowering/fruiting

**Visual plant check routine:**
- Observe indicator plants (known to show stress early)
- Check during hottest part of day (2-4 PM)
- Look at multiple plants per zone
- Record observations consistently

**Simple soil moisture checks:**

**Feel method:**
- Take soil sample from 3-6 inches deep
- Squeeze handful of soil
- **Dry:** Crumbly, won't form ball
- **Adequate:** Forms ball, slightly moist
- **Wet:** Forms muddy ball, water squeezes out

**Screwdriver test:**
- Try to push screwdriver into soil
- **Adequate moisture:** Penetrates easily 6-8 inches
- **Too dry:** Hard to insert, only goes 2-3 inches
- **Too wet:** Very easy, no resistance

**Dig test:**
- Dig 6-12 inch deep hole
- Examine soil moisture at different depths
- Check root zone specifically
- Look for dry layers below surface

**Plant monitoring schedule:**
- Daily visual inspection during hot/dry periods
- 2-3 times weekly during moderate conditions
- Weekly during cool or rainy periods
- More frequent for newly planted areas

### Step 6: Track Rainfall and Weather

**Rain gauge installation:**
- Standard 4-5 inch diameter gauge
- Placement: Open area, away from structures and trees
- Height: 3-5 feet above ground
- Check and record after each rain event
- Empty after recording

**Weather station (advanced option):**
- Tracks rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind
- Calculates evapotranspiration (ET)
- Some models connect to irrigation controllers
- Cost: €100-1,000+ depending on features

**Track key weather data:**
- Daily rainfall totals
- Monthly and annual precipitation
- Compare to historical average
- Record temperature extremes
- Note drought or wet periods

**Evapotranspiration (ET):**
- Measure of water loss from soil and plants
- Available from local weather stations or online
- Reference ET (ETo) for your location
- Apply crop coefficients for your plants
- Use to calculate actual water needs

**Example ET calculation:**
```
Reference ET (ETo): 0.20 inches/day
Crop coefficient for native plants: 0.6
Actual ET = 0.20 × 0.6 = 0.12 inches/day

Weekly water need (no rain): 0.84 inches
If rained 0.5 inches this week: Need 0.34 inches supplemental
```

**Integrate weather and irrigation:**
- Adjust irrigation based on recent rainfall
- Increase during hot, dry, windy periods
- Reduce or skip during cool, humid conditions
- Use ET to determine actual need vs. schedule

### Step 7: Calculate and Track Water Use Metrics

**Key performance indicators (KPIs):**

**Total annual water use:**
- Track year-over-year
- Goal: Reduction from baseline
- Celebrate improvements

**Water use per acre or per plant:**
- Gallons per acre per year
- Gallons per plant per year
- Allows comparison across different site sizes

**Water use efficiency (WUE):**
- Biomass produced or survival rate per unit water
- Example: Pounds of vegetation per 1,000 gallons
- Higher WUE = more efficient

**Percentage from sustainable sources:**
- Rainwater harvested, recycled, etc.
- Goal: Maximize renewable/on-site sources
- Reduce purchased or pumped water

**Irrigation efficiency:**
- Water applied vs. water received by plants
- Account for evaporation, runoff, deep percolation
- Drip systems: 85-95% efficient
- Sprinklers: 60-75% efficient

**Cost metrics (if purchasing water):**
- Cost per gallon
- Annual water expense
- Savings from conservation measures
- Return on investment for efficiency upgrades

**Example dashboard:**
```
Water Use Metrics - Year 2 (Target vs. Actual)

Annual Use:
- Target: 200,000 gal | Actual: 185,000 gal ✓ (26% reduction from baseline)

Per Acre:
- Target: 20,000 gal/acre | Actual: 18,500 gal/acre ✓

Sustainable Sources:
- Target: 40% | Actual: 48% ✓ (89,000 gal harvested)

Cost:
- Target: €700 | Actual: €550 ✓ (€350 savings)

Irrigation Efficiency:
- Target: 75% | Actual: 82% ✓ (upgraded to drip)
```

### Step 8: Identify and Fix Leaks Promptly

**Leak detection methods:**

**Meter-based detection:**
- Turn off all water use
- Check meter - if still moving, there's a leak
- Note flow rate (gal/hour)
- Indicates leak size

**Pressure testing:**
- Pressurize system with all valves closed
- Monitor pressure gauge
- Pressure drop indicates leak
- Helps locate general area

**Visual inspection:**
- Check all visible pipes, connections, valves
- Look for wet spots, drips, corrosion
- Inspect irrigation system during operation
- Check valve boxes for standing water

**Listen for leaks:**
- Hissing sounds near pipes or valves
- Underground leaks may be heard with listening device
- Check at night when quiet

**Common leak locations:**
- Valve seals and packing glands
- Pipe joints and connections
- Damaged or aged pipes
- Irrigation system connections
- Check valves and backflow preventers
- Tank overflow or drainage

**Leak repair priorities:**
- Large leaks: Immediate repair (same day)
- Medium leaks: Repair within week
- Small leaks: Schedule for maintenance
- Document all leaks and repairs

**Calculate leak impact:**
```
Example: Small drip leak
- Rate: 1 drip per second
- Volume: ~5 gallons per day
- Annual waste: 1,825 gallons
- Cost (at €0.005/gal): €9.13/year

Even small leaks add up! Fix promptly.
```

### Step 9: Document and Analyze Data

**Create monitoring logs:**

**Water meter log:**
```
Date | Meter Reading | Daily Use | Weekly Total | Notes

Date | Zone A | Zone B | Zone C | Rainfall | Irrigation
----------------------------------------------------------
1/7  | 45%    | 38%    | 52%    | 0        | Zone B only
1/8  | 43%    | 61%    | 50%    | 0.5"     | None
```

**Rainfall log:**
```
Month | Rainfall | Historic Avg | Difference | % of Normal
------------------------------------------------------------
Jan   | 3.2"     | 4.1"        | -0.9"      | 78%
Feb   | 5.1"     | 3.8"        | +1.3"      | 134%
```

- Response to drought or heavy rain

**Visualization:**
- Create charts and graphs
- Easier to spot trends than raw numbers
- Water use over time (line graph)
- Use by source (pie chart)
- Monthly comparison (bar chart)

### Step 10: Adjust Practices Based on Data

**Use monitoring data to inform decisions:**

**When data shows over-watering:**
- Reduce irrigation frequency or duration
- Adjust soil moisture set points
- Check for system over-performance
- Improve drainage if chronic problem

**When data shows under-watering:**
- Increase irrigation or frequency
- Verify system is working properly
- Check for distribution uniformity issues
- Consider adding water storage

**When water use exceeds targets:**
- Audit irrigation system efficiency
- Check for leaks
- Review plant selections (too thirsty?)
- Increase mulching or other conservation
- Consider reducing irrigated area

**When meeting or exceeding goals:**
- Document success
- Maintain practices that work
- Look for further optimization
- Share strategies with others

**Adaptive management cycle:**
1. **Monitor** → Collect data
2. **Analyze** → Identify patterns and problems
3. **Decide** → Choose adjustments
4. **Implement** → Make changes
5. **Monitor** → Assess results of changes
6. **Repeat** → Continuous improvement

**Example adaptation:**
```
Observation: Zone C uses 30% more water than Zones A and B
Analysis: Zone C has more sun exposure, lighter soil
Decision: Add 2 inches mulch, reduce irrigation frequency but increase duration
Implementation: Applied mulch, adjusted controller
Monitoring: Zone C use decreased 18% over next month
Result: Continue practice, consider for similar zones
```
