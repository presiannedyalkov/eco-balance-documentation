← Back to [[README|Implementation Tasks]] | [[00_Water_Management_Overview|Water Management Overview]]

---

## 📋 Purpose

Water storage structures bridge the gap between when rain falls and when water is needed. By capturing and holding water during surplus periods, you ensure availability during dry seasons and droughts. Storage can range from simple rain barrels to elaborate pond systems, each with specific advantages and applications. This task guides you through selecting, designing, and building appropriate water storage for your restoration site.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Store water from wet periods for use during dry periods
- Provide reliable irrigation water supply
- Create emergency water reserves for drought
- Support wildlife with permanent water features
- Enhance site aesthetics and function
- Build water security and resilience
- Reduce dependence on external water sources
- Integrate storage with broader restoration goals

## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Determine Storage Needs

**Review water budget:**
- Refer to [[01_Assess_Water_Needs|Assess Water Needs]]
- Identify monthly deficits requiring irrigation
- Calculate total volume needed
- Consider peak demand periods

**Storage capacity calculation:**
- Sum of deficit months = minimum storage
- Add 20-30% buffer for variability
- Consider multiple years of drought
- Balance need vs. cost

**Example:**
- Irrigation needs: May-September
- Monthly deficit: 2, 3, 4, 4, 3 inches over 1 acre
- Total: 16 inches × 1 acre = 435,000 gallons
- Practical storage: 10,000-20,000 gallons (prioritize high-value areas)

**Other factors:**
- Fire suppression requirements
- Wildlife watering needs
- Multiple use benefits
- Future expansion plans

### Step 2: Choose Storage Type

**Above-ground tanks/cisterns:**

- Vent: Screened to prevent mosquitoes
- Access hatch: For cleaning and inspection
- Level indicator: Visual gauge

**Foundation for tanks:**
- Gravel pad (compacted)
- Concrete slab for large tanks
- Blocking/piers to elevate for gravity flow
- Account for full weight (8.3 lbs/gallon + tank)

**Pond design elements:**
- **Dam:** If creating reservoir
  - Core: Impermeable clay
  - Shell: Compacted soil
  - Spillway: For overflow management
  - Emergency spillway: For extreme events
- **Liner:** If soil too permeable
  - EPDM or PVC rubber (45-60 mil)
  - Underlayment to protect from punctures
  - Anchor in trench around perimeter
- **Depth:** 
  - Minimum: 4-6 feet to prevent freezing
  - Optimal: 8-12 feet for cool water, less evaporation
  - Shallow shelf: 6-18 inches for habitat
- **Shape:** 
  - Irregular more natural-looking
  - 3:1 slope for stability and safety
