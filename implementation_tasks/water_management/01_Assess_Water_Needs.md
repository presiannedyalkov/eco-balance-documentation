← Back to [[README|Implementation Tasks]] | [[00_Water_Management_Overview|Water Management Overview]]

---

## 📋 Purpose

Understanding your site's water needs and availability is the foundation of effective water management. This assessment reveals the gap between natural water supply and plant requirements, identifies opportunities for water harvesting and conservation, and guides decisions about irrigation, storage, and drought preparedness. A thorough water needs assessment prevents costly mistakes and ensures your restoration efforts are sustainable and appropriate for your climate.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Quantify annual and seasonal precipitation patterns
- Calculate evapotranspiration rates for your location
- Determine water requirements for target plant communities
- Assess soil water-holding capacity
- Identify existing water sources and potential
- Create a water budget (supply vs. demand)
- Determine irrigation needs and timing
- Plan for drought and wet year scenarios
- Establish baseline for ongoing water monitoring

## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Research Climate and Precipitation Data

**Gather historical precipitation data:**
- Average annual rainfall for your location
- Monthly distribution of rainfall (seasonal patterns)
- Rainfall variability (drought vs. wet years)
- Snow accumulation if applicable
- Recent trends (last 10-20 years)
- Climate change projections for your region

**Data sources:**
- NOAA National Weather Service
- State climatology offices
- Local weather stations
- Agricultural extension services
- Weather.gov historical data
- Climate.gov resources

**Key metrics to collect:**
- Average annual precipitation (inches or mm)
- Wettest and driest months
- Number of rain days per year
- Intensity patterns (gentle rains vs. downpours)
- Frost-free growing season length
- Humidity levels

**Example analysis:**
- Location: Central California
- Annual rainfall: 18 inches
- Pattern: 90% falls October-April, <5% May-September
- Drought years: As low as 8 inches
- Wet years: Up to 35 inches

### Step 2: Calculate Evapotranspiration (ET)

**What is ET:**
- Water lost through plant transpiration + soil evaporation
- Critical for understanding how much water plants actually need
- Varies by temperature, humidity, wind, and plant type

**How to calculate:**
- Use reference ET (ETo) data from weather stations or services
- Multiply ETo by crop coefficient for your vegetation type
- Account for seasonal variation

**Find ETo data:**
- CIMIS (California) or similar state networks
- Extension service calculators
- Weather station networks
- Online ET calculators

**Crop coefficients (Kc):**
- Native grassland: 0.6-0.8
- Forest/woodland: 0.8-1.0
- Agricultural crops: 0.3-1.2 depending on type
- Newly planted areas: 0.5-0.7 during establishment

**Example calculation:**
- Annual ETo: 50 inches
- Target vegetation: Native oak woodland (Kc = 0.85)
- Actual ET need: 50 × 0.85 = 42.5 inches

### Step 3: Assess Soil Water-Holding Capacity

**Why it matters:**
- Soil acts as water storage between rain events
- Different soils hold vastly different amounts
- Determines irrigation frequency and drought vulnerability

**Soil texture and water holding:**
- **Sand:** 0.5-1.0 inches per foot depth
- **Loam:** 1.5-2.0 inches per foot depth
- **Clay:** 2.0-2.5 inches per foot depth
- **Organic matter:** Each 1% increase = ~0.2 inches more storage

**How to assess:**
- Review soil assessment from [[../soil_restoration/01_Assess_Soil_Health|Assess Soil Health]]
- Soil texture determines base capacity
- Organic matter percentage affects capacity
- Root zone depth determines total available storage

**Calculate total plant-available water:**
- Root zone depth (typically 1-4 feet)
- × Water holding capacity per foot
- = Total water reservoir in soil

**Example:**
- Soil: Sandy loam (1.2 inches/foot)
- Root zone: 3 feet deep
- Organic matter: 4% (adds 0.4 inches/foot)
- Total capacity: (1.2 + 0.4) × 3 = 4.8 inches stored

### Step 4: Determine Plant Water Requirements

**Factors affecting requirements:**
- Plant species (native vs. non-native)
- Growth stage (establishment vs. mature)
- Planting density
- Microclimate (sun/shade, wind exposure)
- Season and temperature

**Native vs. adapted species:**
- Native plants evolved for local rainfall patterns
- Typically require no irrigation once established (2-3 years)
- During establishment: 50-75% of ET needs
- May need summer water in first 1-2 years

**Establishment phase (Years 1-3):**
- Trees: 5-15 gallons per week per tree (summer)
- Shrubs: 2-5 gallons per week per shrub (summer)
- Groundcover/grasses: 0.5-1 inch per week
- Decrease gradually as roots establish

**Mature phase (Year 3+):**
- Well-adapted native vegetation: minimal to no supplemental water
- Some water during extreme drought may help survival
- Focus shifts to drought management strategies

**Create plant water needs table:**
| Vegetation Type | Establishment (in/wk) | Mature (in/yr) | Peak Season |
|----------------|----------------------|----------------|-------------|
| Native trees | 1.0-1.5 | 0-10 | Summer |
| Native shrubs | 0.5-1.0 | 0-5 | Summer |
| Grasses/forbs | 0.5-0.75 | 0-3 | Spring |

### Step 5: Identify Existing and Potential Water Sources

**Natural water sources:**
- **Precipitation:** Direct rainfall on site (primary source)
- **Runoff:** Water flowing onto site from upslope areas
- **Groundwater:** Wells, springs, seeps (if present)
- **Surface water:** Streams, creeks, ponds (if present)
- **Fog/dew:** Significant in some coastal climates

**Developed water sources:**
- **Municipal water:** Cost, reliability, restrictions?
- **Irrigation district:** Agricultural water availability
- **Recycled water:** Treated wastewater (quality considerations)
- **Well water:** Depth, yield, quality, legality

**Potential sources to develop:**
- **Rainwater harvesting:** From roofs, hard surfaces
- **Runoff capture:** From roads, paths, parking areas
- **Stormwater:** Currently leaving site as waste
- **Greywater:** From buildings if applicable and legal

**Quantify each source:**
- Precipitation: Site area × annual rainfall = total volume
- Runoff: Watershed area × rainfall × runoff coefficient
- Groundwater: Pump test or spring flow measurement
- Harvesting potential: Surface area × rainfall × collection efficiency

**Example calculation:**
- Site area: 5 acres = 217,800 sq ft
- Annual rainfall: 20 inches = 1.67 feet
- Total rainfall on site: 217,800 × 1.67 = 363,726 cubic feet = 2.7 million gallons/year
- Harvested from 10,000 sq ft roof: 10,000 × 1.67 = 16,700 cubic feet = 125,000 gallons/year

### Step 6: Create a Water Budget

**Water budget equation:**
**Supply - Demand = Surplus or Deficit**

**Supply (inputs):**
- Precipitation on site
- Runoff captured
- Other sources (well, municipal, etc.)
- Stored water available

**Demand (outputs):**
- Plant evapotranspiration
- Soil evaporation (minimized by mulch)
- Unavoidable runoff/deep percolation
- Other uses (wildlife watering, fire protection)

**Monthly breakdown:**
Create table showing monthly supply vs. demand

| Month | Precip (in) | ET (in) | Balance | Cumulative |
|-------|-------------|---------|---------|------------|
| Jan | 4.0 | 1.5 | +2.5 | +2.5 |
| Feb | 3.5 | 2.0 | +1.5 | +4.0 |
| Mar | 2.5 | 3.0 | -0.5 | +3.5 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| Jul | 0.0 | 7.0 | -7.0 | -8.5 |
| Aug | 0.0 | 6.5 | -6.5 | -15.0 |

**Interpret results:**
- **Surplus months:** Opportunity for water harvesting/storage
- **Deficit months:** Need irrigation, stored water, or drought management
- **Annual balance:** Positive = adequate water; Negative = chronic shortage

### Step 7: Determine Irrigation Requirements

**If annual deficit exists:**
- Calculate total irrigation needed to close gap
- Determine peak irrigation month requirements
- Plan system capacity for peak demand
- Consider irrigation schedule and frequency

**Irrigation volume calculation:**
- Deficit months total: e.g., 15 inches over 6 months
- Site area needing irrigation: e.g., 2 acres
- Total volume: 15 inches × 2 acres = 2.5 acre-feet = 815,000 gallons
- Peak month: 3.5 inches × 2 acres = 190,000 gallons

**System sizing:**
- Peak daily demand during hottest month
- Flow rate needed (gallons per minute or hour)
- Pressure requirements for irrigation type
- Storage capacity if not continuous supply

**Phased approach:**
- Year 1-2: Higher irrigation for establishment
- Year 3-5: Reduced as plants mature
- Year 5+: Minimal or emergency only

### Step 8: Plan for Variability

**Drought planning:**
- What if rainfall is 50% of average?
- Can you reduce irrigation without plant loss?
- Priority areas if water must be rationed
- Emergency water sources
- Drought-tolerant species as backup plan

**Wet year planning:**
- What if rainfall is 150% of average?
- Erosion control measures needed?
- Excess water storage opportunities
- Flooding risk assessment

**Climate change considerations:**
- Precipitation trends in your region
- Temperature increases (higher ET)
- Increased variability (extremes more common)
- Design for flexibility and adaptation

### Step 9: Document Your Assessment

**Create comprehensive water needs report:**
- Executive summary
- Climate and precipitation analysis
- Evapotranspiration calculations

## 📊 Quick Reference: Water Volume Conversions

**Useful conversions:**
- 1 inch of rain on 1 acre = 27,154 gallons
- 1 acre-foot = 325,851 gallons
- 1 cubic foot = 7.48 gallons
- 1,000 square feet × 1 inch rain = 623 gallons

**Rule of thumb:**
- Site area (sq ft) × rainfall (inches) ÷ 12 = cubic feet of water
- Cubic feet × 7.48 = gallons
