# Step 4: Plant the Seedlings

← Back to [[00_Reforestation_Overview|Reforestation Overview]] | [[../README|Implementation Tasks]]

---

## Purpose

**Proper planting technique** is the most critical moment in the restoration process. Even healthy seedlings from ideal sites will fail if planted incorrectly. This step ensures each tree gets the best possible start.

---

## Prerequisites

- ✅ Land prepared → [[03_Prepare_Land|Step 3]]
- ✅ Seedlings delivered and healthy
- ✅ Planting team trained and ready
- ✅ Weather conditions favorable
- ✅ Tools and materials on-site

---

## Planting Technique

### 1. Timing
**Optimal seasons for Southern Europe:**
- **Autumn (Oct-Nov):** Best - soil warm, winter rains ahead
- **Early Spring (Feb-Mar):** Good - before summer stress
- **Avoid:** Summer heat and winter freezes

**Time of day:** Early morning or late afternoon (avoid midday heat)

### 2. Hole Preparation
**For each tree:**
- Dig hole **2-3x wider** than root ball
- Depth: Same as container/root collar depth (NOT deeper)
- Loosen soil on sides and bottom
- Remove rocks and debris
- Save topsoil separately

### 3. Seedling Handling
**Critical care:**
- Keep roots moist until planting (wet burlap covering)
- Never leave roots exposed to sun/wind
- Handle gently - don't drop or damage
- Plant within 30 minutes of removing from container

**Container-grown:**
- Gently remove from pot
- Loosen circling roots
- Prune damaged roots
- Keep root ball intact

**Bare-root:**
- Soak roots 2-4 hours before planting
- Prune broken or damaged roots
- Keep in water bucket until planting
- Never let roots dry out

### 4. Placement
**In the hole:**
- Position at correct depth (root collar at soil surface)
- Ensure tree is straight and upright
- Orient best side toward viewing direction
- Root spread naturally (no circling)

### 5. Backfilling
**Fill hole carefully:**
- Use native soil mixed with compost (50/50)
- Fill in layers, firming gently
- Eliminate air pockets
- Create slight depression for water retention
- NO soil over root collar

### 6. Initial Watering
**First watering is critical:**
- Water deeply immediately after planting
- 10-20 liters per tree (depending on size)
- Let water soak in completely
- Water again if soil sinks
- Creates good soil-root contact

### 7. Mulching
**Apply organic mulch:**
- 5-10cm layer around base
- Extend to drip line radius
- Keep mulch away from trunk (5cm gap)
- Suppresses weeds and retains moisture
- Moderates soil temperature

### 8. Protection
**Protect young trees:**
- Tree guards against herbivores
- Stakes if needed (only on windy sites)
- Remove stakes after 1 year
- Mark with flag for visibility

## Team Organization

**Planting crew roles:**

**Team Leader:**
- Coordinates activities
- Ensures quality control
- Tracks progress
- Troubleshoots issues

**Diggers (2-3 people):**
- Prepare holes
- Work ahead of planters
- Maintain proper spacing

**Planters (2-4 people):**
- Place seedlings
- Backfill correctly
- Create water wells
- Quality check

**Waterers (1-2 people):**
- Follow planters
- Deep watering each tree
- Refill water containers

**Mulchers (1-2 people):**
- Apply mulch layer
- Install guards
- Mark trees
- Final check

**Efficiency:** Well-organized team can plant 50-100 trees/day

---

## Quality Control

**Check each tree:**
- ✅ Correct depth (root collar visible)
- ✅ Straight and stable
- ✅ Soil firmly packed (no air pockets)
- ✅ Properly watered
- ✅ Mulched correctly
- ✅ Protected/marked

**Document:**
- Trees planted per day
- Species and locations
- Any issues or mortality on arrival
- Weather conditions
- Photos of planting process

---

## Resources Needed

**Tools (per 5-person team):**
- 5 shovels
- 2 pickaxes (rocky soil)
- 5 pairs gloves
- Water containers/tanks
- Watering cans or hoses
- Wheelbarrows (3)
- Flags/markers
- Measuring tape

**Materials:**
- Seedlings
- Mulch (50L per tree)
- Compost/amendments
- Tree guards
- Stakes (if needed)
- Water (20L per tree)
- First aid kit

## Common Challenges & Solutions

**Problem:** Trees planted too deep → stems rot
**Solution:** Plant at exact root collar depth, use measuring stick

**Problem:** Air pockets around roots → poor establishment
**Solution:** Firm soil carefully while backfilling, water thoroughly

**Problem:** Planting in wrong microhabitat → stress/death
**Solution:** Match species to site as marked → [[01_Identify_Native_Species|Species Selection]]

**Problem:** Insufficient watering → drought stress
**Solution:** Water deeply (not frequently and shallow), create water well

**Problem:** Fast-drying windy conditions → root damage
**Solution:** Work in sections, keep roots covered, plant quickly

---

## Success Criteria

✅ **All trees planted** at correct depth and spacing

✅ **Immediate survival** >95% (no DOA or planting damage deaths)

✅ **Proper technique** followed consistently

✅ **Documentation complete** with locations and counts

✅ **Team trained** and working efficiently

---

## Next Steps

**After planting:**

→ [[05_Monitor_Growth|Step 5: Monitor Growth]]
- Begin monitoring schedule
- Check survival weekly (first month)
- Prepare for maintenance

**Immediate follow-up:**
- Water again if no rain within 3 days
- Check guards and stakes
- Replace any immediate failures
- Thank volunteers and team
