# Task 1: Identify Native Species

← Back to [[00_Reforestation_Overview|Reforestation Overview]]

---

## Purpose

Identifying the right native species is the **foundation of successful reforestation**. Native species are adapted to local conditions and play essential roles in the ecosystem, supporting local wildlife and maintaining ecological balance.

---

## What You'll Do

Research and select native trees and shrubs that are suitable for your restoration site, considering climate, soil conditions, and ecological needs.

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Research Native Flora

**Information Sources:**
- Local conservation organizations
- University botany departments
- Regional botanical gardens
- Government forestry agencies
- Historical vegetation surveys

**Key Resources:**
- Plant databases (e.g., Native Plant Societies)
- Regional flora guides
- Academic publications on local ecology
- Traditional ecological knowledge from elders

### 2. Assess Site Conditions

**Climate Factors:**
- Average annual rainfall
- Temperature ranges (extremes and averages)
- Frost patterns and growing season
- Wind exposure
- Microclimate variations

**Soil Characteristics:**
- Soil type and texture
- pH levels
- Drainage patterns
- Organic matter content
- Existing vegetation indicators

→ Reference: [[soil_restoration/01_Assess_Soil_Health|Assess Soil Health]]

### 3. Evaluate Species Suitability

**For Each Potential Species, Consider:**

**Growth Characteristics:**
- Growth rate (fast vs. slow)
- Mature size (height and spread)
- Root system type (deep taproot vs. shallow)
- Lifespan and longevity

**Climate Adaptation:**
- Drought tolerance (critical for Southern Europe)
- Heat tolerance
- Cold hardiness
- Wind resistance
- Fire resistance (where relevant)

**Ecological Role:**
- Food source for wildlife (fruit, nuts, flowers)
- Habitat value (nesting, shelter)
- Nitrogen fixation (legumes)
- Soil stabilization
- Pollinator support

**Maintenance Requirements:**
- Water needs during establishment
- Pest and disease susceptibility
- Pruning requirements
- Compatibility with other species

### 4. Create Diverse Species Mix

**Avoid Monocultures:**
- Select 10-20 different species minimum
- Mix of trees and shrubs
- Various heights creating canopy layers
- Different bloom/fruit times for year-round wildlife support

**Structural Diversity:**
- Canopy layer (tall trees)
- Understory layer (smaller trees)
- Shrub layer
- Ground cover layer

**Functional Diversity:**
- Pioneer species (fast-growing, soil-improving)
- Climax species (long-lived, forest-forming)
- Nitrogen-fixers (legumes)
- Wildlife specialists (heavy fruit/nut producers)

### 5. Consult Experts

**Essential Consultations:**
- **Botanist or Ecologist:** Species identification and ecology
- **Local Nurseries:** Availability and sourcing advice
- **Conservation Groups:** Experience with local restoration
- **Landowners/Farmers:** Historical land use and changes
- **Indigenous Communities:** Traditional ecological knowledge

**Questions to Ask:**
- What species historically grew here?
- What species are thriving in similar nearby areas?
- What species are declining and why?
- Are there any rare or protected species to consider?
- What species should be avoided (invasive risk)?

## Priority Species for Southern Europe

**Based on Climate Resilience:**

**Drought-Tolerant Trees:**
- Holm Oak (*Quercus ilex*)
- Cork Oak (*Quercus suber*)
- Stone Pine (*Pinus pinea*)
- Carob (*Ceratonia siliqua*)
- Olive (*Olea europaea*)

**Nitrogen-Fixing Species:**
- Acacia species (native varieties)
- Alder (*Alnus* species)
- Leguminous shrubs

**Wildlife Value Species:**
- Mastic Tree (*Pistacia lentiscus*)
- Strawberry Tree (*Arbutus unedo*)
- Wild Pear (*Pyrus pyraster*)

*Note: Always verify species appropriateness for your specific location with local experts.*

---

## Deliverables

By the end of this task, you should have:

✅ **Species List:** 10-20 native species with scientific and common names

✅ **Species Profiles:** For each species, document:
   - Growth characteristics
   - Climate/soil requirements
   - Ecological role
   - Planting specifications
   - Maintenance needs

✅ **Planting Mix Design:** Proportion of each species to plant (e.g., 30% Oak, 20% Pine, etc.)

✅ **Expert Validation:** Confirmation from botanist/ecologist that selections are appropriate

---

## Timeline

**Duration:** 2-4 weeks

**Breakdown:**
- Week 1: Initial research and information gathering
- Week 2: Expert consultations
- Week 3: Species evaluation and selection
- Week 4: Documentation and validation

---

## Budget Considerations

**Typical Costs:**
- Expert consultation fees: €500-1,500
- Reference materials/databases: €100-300
- Site assessment tools: €200-500

→ See: [[30_Business_Model|Business Model]] for budget allocation

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Don't:**
- Choose non-native or invasive species (even if "pretty")
- Select only fast-growing species (need diversity)
- Ignore climate projections (choose future-adapted species)
- Rely solely on commercial nursery availability
- Plant monocultures

✅ **Do:**
- Prioritize native, locally-adapted species
- Create diverse age and species structure
- Consider climate change resilience
- Validate choices with multiple experts
- Plan for ecosystem function, not just aesthetics

---

## Success Indicators

**You're ready to move to the next task when:**
- Species list is complete and expert-validated
- Species profiles are documented
- Planting mix proportions are defined
- You understand the ecological role of each species
- You have confidence in your selections
