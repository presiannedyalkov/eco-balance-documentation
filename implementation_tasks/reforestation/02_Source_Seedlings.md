# Task 2: Source Seedlings

← Back to [[00_Reforestation_Overview|Reforestation Overview]]

---

## Purpose

Once you've identified the right species, you need to find high-quality, healthy seedlings from reputable sources. Quality seedlings are essential for high survival rates and successful ecosystem restoration.

---

## What You'll Do

Identify and engage with nurseries, conservation organizations, or commercial suppliers to source healthy, disease-free seedlings of your selected native species.

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Identify Potential Suppliers

**Supplier Types:**

**Native Plant Nurseries:**
- Specialize in native species
- Often have expertise in local ecology
- May offer smaller quantities
- Usually more expensive but higher quality

**Conservation Organizations:**
- May have seedling programs
- Often subsidized pricing for restoration projects
- Can provide technical support
- May have limited species selection

**Government Forestry Programs:**
- Sometimes offer free/subsidized seedlings
- May have requirements (land size, management plans)
- Limited to certain species
- Can have long lead times

**Commercial Suppliers:**
- Large quantities available
- Competitive pricing
- May not specialize in natives
- Quality can vary

**Community Seed Banks:**
- Local seed collection and propagation
- Best local genetic adaptation
- May need lead time for growing
- Supports community engagement

### 2. Evaluate Supplier Quality

**Key Questions to Ask:**

**About the Seedlings:**
- Are they grown from locally-sourced seeds?
- What is the genetic provenance (origin)?
- What age/size are the seedlings?
- What is the typical survival rate?
- Are they disease-free and certified?
- What container type (bare root, pot, plug)?

**About Growing Conditions:**
- Were they grown in conditions similar to planting site?
- What fertilizers/treatments were used?
- Are they hardened off for field conditions?

**Logistics:**
- What is the lead time for orders?
- What quantities are available?
- What is the delivery schedule?
- What are the costs (per seedling, delivery, etc.)?
- What guarantees or warranties are offered?

### 3. Determine Quantities

**Calculate Needs Based On:**

**Planting Area:**
- Total hectares to be planted
- Desired tree density (trees per hectare)
- Species mix proportions

**Expected Survival Rate:**
- Order 20-30% more than needed
- Account for mortality during establishment
- Have backup seedlings for replacement

**Example Calculation (Bootstrap Model - 1 hectare):**
```
Area: 1 hectare
Density: 1,000 trees/hectare (dense restoration planting)
Base need: 1,000 seedlings
Buffer (25%): 250 seedlings
Total order: 1,250 seedlings
```

**Species Breakdown:**
Apply your species mix percentages:
- 30% Oak = 375 seedlings
- 20% Pine = 250 seedlings
- 15% Carob = 188 seedlings
- etc.

### 4. Request Quotes

**Information to Provide:**
- Species and quantities needed
- Preferred seedling size/age
- Delivery location and timing
- Your organization status (NGO for potential discounts)
- Project overview (restoration vs. commercial)

**Compare:**
- Price per seedling
- Delivery costs
- Payment terms
- Lead time
- Quality certifications
- Support/advice offered

### 5. Time Your Order

**Critical Timing Considerations:**

**Planting Season:**
- Match delivery to optimal planting time
- Southern Europe: typically autumn (October-November) or early spring (February-March)
- Avoid summer planting (high mortality)

**Lead Time:**
- Native nurseries: 3-6 months minimum
- Custom propagation: 6-12+ months
- Popular species: may require 1+ year advance order

**Delivery Window:**
- Schedule delivery 1-2 weeks before planting
- Seedlings should be planted ASAP after delivery
- Don't order too early (storage challenges)
- Weather backup plan if planting delayed

### 6. Arrange Storage

**If Temporary Storage Needed:**

**Short-term (1-2 weeks):**
- Keep in original containers
- Store in shade
- Water regularly (don't let dry out)
- Protect from wind and extreme temperatures
- Maintain 100% humidity if possible

**Longer-term Storage (avoid if possible):**
- Heeling in (planting temporarily in soil)
- Cold storage facility (for bare root)
- Professional nursery boarding

### 7. Inspect Upon Delivery

**Quality Checks:**

**Visual Inspection:**
- ✅ Healthy green foliage
- ✅ Strong, undamaged stems
- ✅ Well-developed root system
- ✅ No signs of disease or pests
- ✅ Appropriate size for species/age

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ Wilted or yellow leaves
- ❌ Broken or damaged stems
- ❌ Root-bound or circling roots
- ❌ Mold or fungal growth
- ❌ Insect infestation

**Documentation:**
- Count seedlings received
- Photograph overall delivery
- Document any quality issues
- Report problems immediately to supplier

---

## Supplier Vetting Checklist

Before committing to a supplier, verify:

✅ **Reputation:** References from other restoration projects

✅ **Certifications:** Nursery licenses, disease-free certifications

✅ **Provenance:** Seeds sourced locally (within 100-200 km ideally)

✅ **Experience:** Track record with native species

✅ **Support:** Willing to provide planting advice

✅ **Terms:** Clear contracts, guarantees, refund policies

---

## Budget Planning

**Typical Costs (Southern Europe):**
- Native seedlings: €2-10 per plant (varies by species, size)
- Bare root stock: €1-3 per plant (cheaper, requires care)
- Container plants: €5-15 per plant (easier to establish)
- Delivery: €100-500 (depends on distance and quantity)

**For 1,000-1,250 seedlings (1 hectare Bootstrap):**
- Budget estimate: €2,500-8,000
- Add 20% contingency: €3,000-10,000

**Bootstrap Model Note:**
- 1 hectare pilot site requires 1,000-1,250 seedlings (with buffer)
- Dense planting (1,000 trees/ha) for faster canopy closure
- Seedling budget fits within €20-30k Year 1 total budget
- For larger sites post-pilot, scale calculations proportionally

## Local vs. Non-Local Sourcing

**Prioritize Local Genetic Material:**

**Why Local Matters:**
- Adapted to local climate and soil
- Supports local seed/nursery economy
- Maintains genetic diversity
- Better long-term survival
- Regulatory compliance (some regions require)

**Acceptable Non-Local Sourcing:**
- Same species, similar climate zone
- When local sources unavailable
- For diversity in small gene pools
- With expert guidance

**Avoid:**
- Different subspecies or ecotypes
- Cultivars or horticultural varieties
- Non-native species
- Untested provenance

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Don't:**
- Order too late (miss planting season)
- Rely on single supplier (risk if they fail)
- Choose cheapest option without quality check
- Accept non-local provenance without consideration
- Forget to account for mortality/replacement needs

✅ **Do:**
- Order well in advance
- Diversify suppliers for key species
- Visit nurseries in person if possible
- Verify genetic provenance
- Build relationships with quality suppliers

---

## Deliverables

By the end of this task, you should have:

✅ **Supplier List:** 2-3 vetted, reliable suppliers

✅ **Purchase Orders:** Confirmed orders with delivery dates

✅ **Species Quantities:** Exact numbers for each species ordered

✅ **Budget Confirmed:** Actual costs vs. planned budget

✅ **Delivery Schedule:** Coordinated with planting timeline

✅ **Quality Standards:** Documented expectations and inspection criteria

---

## Timeline

**Duration:** 4-6 weeks (plus lead time)

**Breakdown:**
- Week 1: Identify and research suppliers
- Week 2: Request quotes and compare
- Week 3: Site visits or detailed discussions
- Week 4: Place orders and finalize contracts
- Weeks 5-6+: Lead time until delivery

**Note:** For custom propagation or rare species, add 6-12 months lead time.

---

## Success Indicators

**You're ready to move to the next task when:**
- Orders are placed and confirmed
- Delivery dates are scheduled
- Budget is approved and allocated
- Storage/handling plan is ready
