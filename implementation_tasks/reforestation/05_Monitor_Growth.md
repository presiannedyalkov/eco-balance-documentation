# Task 5: Monitor Growth

← Back to [[00_Reforestation_Overview|Reforestation Overview]]

---

## Purpose

Regular monitoring is essential to track seedling survival, health, and growth. Early detection of problems allows for quick intervention, and data collection provides insights for adaptive management and future projects.

---

## What You'll Do

Establish and execute a systematic monitoring program to track seedling performance, identify problems, and document restoration success over time.

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Establish Monitoring Schedule

**Frequency:**

**Year 1 (Critical Establishment Period):**
- **Week 1-4:** Every 3-5 days (high mortality risk)
- **Months 2-6:** Weekly
- **Months 7-12:** Bi-weekly to monthly

**Year 2:**
- Monthly during growing season
- Quarterly during dormant season

**Year 3+:**
- Quarterly monitoring
- Annual comprehensive assessment

**Seasonal Considerations:**
- More frequent in summer (heat stress)
- Less frequent in winter (dormancy)
- After extreme weather events (drought, storms, heat waves)

### 2. What to Monitor

**Individual Seedling Health:**

**Visual Assessment:**
- ✅ **Healthy:** Green foliage, upright, growing
- ⚠️ **Stressed:** Wilted, yellowing, stunted
- ❌ **Dead:** Brown/crispy foliage, brittle stems

**Specific Indicators:**

**Positive Signs:**
- New growth (shoots, leaves)
- Healthy leaf color for species
- Firm, resilient stems
- No insect or disease damage
- Growing toward light

**Warning Signs:**
- Wilting despite adequate water
- Discolored leaves (yellowing, browning, spotting)
- Stunted growth
- Insect infestation
- Fungal growth
- Browsing damage (wildlife)

**Critical Problems:**
- Dead or dying seedlings
- Severe defoliation
- Broken or damaged stems
- Root exposure
- Disease spreading through planting

### 3. Measure Growth Metrics

**Track These Measurements:**

**Survival Rate:**
- Count living vs. dead seedlings
- Calculate percentage by species
- Identify patterns (location, species, timing)
- Target: >70% Year 1, >60% Year 3

**Height Growth:**
- Measure from ground to tallest point
- Record every 3-6 months
- Track annual growth rate
- Compare to species expectations

**Stem Diameter:**
- Measure at 10 cm above ground (Year 1-2)
- Measure at breast height/1.3 m (Year 3+)
- Use diameter tape or calipers
- Track annual increase

**Canopy Spread:**
- Measure maximum branch spread
- Note in two perpendicular directions
- Average for canopy diameter
- Track annual expansion

**Health Score:**
Create simple 1-5 scale:
- 5: Excellent health, vigorous growth
- 4: Good health, steady growth
- 3: Fair health, some stress signs
- 2: Poor health, significant stress
- 1: Dying or dead

### 4. Use Technology

**Manual Methods:**
- Clipboard and data sheets
- Measuring tape and calipers
- Camera for documentation
- GPS for mapping

**Technology Tools:**
- **Mobile apps:** KoboCollect, ODK, custom forms
- **GPS:** Accurate location tracking
- **Drones:** Aerial imagery and vegetation indices
- **Cameras:** Time-lapse or camera traps
- **Sensors:** Soil moisture at key locations

→ See: [[../../21_Technology_Integration|Technology Integration]]

**Data Management:**
- Enter data promptly (same day if possible)
- Back up regularly
- Use consistent formats
- Include photos and notes

### 5. Water Management Monitoring

**Track Water Status:**

**Soil Moisture:**
- Use soil probe or sensor
- Check at root depth (20-30 cm)
- Multiple locations across site
- Correlate with seedling health

**Seedling Water Stress:**
- Wilting during heat of day
- Drooping leaves
- Leaf curling or folding
- Slow growth despite good conditions

**Irrigation Effectiveness:**
- Is water reaching all areas?
- Are some areas over/under watered?
- Is timing optimal?
- Are adjustments needed?

→ Reference: [[water_management/06_Monitor_Water_Use|Monitor Water Use]]

### 6. Problem Identification & Response

**Common Problems and Solutions:**

**High Mortality in Specific Area:**
- **Possible causes:** Poor drainage, compacted soil, pest damage
- **Response:** Investigate root cause, improve conditions, replant with adapted species

**Yellowing Leaves:**
- **Possible causes:** Nutrient deficiency, over-watering, root problems
- **Response:** Test soil, adjust watering, add compost if needed

**Browsing Damage:**
- **Possible causes:** Deer, rabbits, livestock
- **Response:** Install protection (tree shelters, fencing), plant unpalatable species

**Weed Competition:**
- **Possible causes:** Insufficient mulch, disturbed soil
- **Response:** Add mulch, hand-weed around seedlings

**Pest Infestation:**
- **Possible causes:** Stressed plants attract pests
- **Response:** Identify pest, use appropriate treatment (prefer biological controls)

**Slow Growth:**
- **Possible causes:** Poor soil, insufficient water, competition
- **Response:** Improve soil, adjust irrigation, remove competing vegetation

### 7. Document Everything

**Record for Each Visit:**

**Date and Conditions:**
- Date and time
- Weather (temperature, precipitation)
- Recent weather events
- Soil moisture conditions

**Observations:**
- Overall site condition
- Individual seedling notes
- Problems identified
- Wildlife activity
- Weed pressure

**Actions Taken:**
- Watering
- Weeding
- Replacements
- Treatments applied
- Other interventions

**Measurements:**
- Survival counts
- Growth measurements
- Photos (consistent angles/locations)

**Recommendations:**
- What needs to be done next
- Changes to management
- Follow-up required

### 8. Replacement Strategy

**When to Replace:**
- Seedlings dead >4 weeks
- Unlikely to recover from damage
- During appropriate planting season

**Replacement Timing:**
- **Autumn/Spring:** Best for replacements
- **Avoid:** Same season as mortality (likely to fail again)
- **Consider:** Why did seedling die? Fix problem first.

**Replacement Stock:**
- Keep backup seedlings (10-20% of order)
- Source additional if needed
- May need to wait for next planting season
- Consider more adapted species for problem areas
