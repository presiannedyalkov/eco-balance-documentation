# Assess Soil Health

← Back to [[README|Implementation Tasks]] | [[00_Soil_Restoration_Overview|Soil Restoration Overview]]

---

## 📋 Purpose

Assessing soil health is the critical first step in any soil restoration effort. Without understanding your baseline conditions, you cannot develop an effective restoration strategy or measure your progress. A comprehensive soil assessment reveals nutrient deficiencies, contamination issues, structural problems, and biological activity levels, allowing you to create a targeted, science-based restoration plan.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Determine current soil nutrient levels (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, micronutrients)
- Measure soil pH and identify any acidity or alkalinity issues
- Assess organic matter content and quality
- Evaluate soil structure, texture, and compaction levels
- Test for contaminants or toxins if site history suggests potential issues
- Identify beneficial soil organisms (earthworms, mycorrhizal fungi, microbes)
- Establish baseline metrics for future monitoring
- Create detailed soil maps showing variability across the site

## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Plan Your Sampling Strategy

**Create a sampling grid:**
- Divide large sites into zones based on topography, vegetation, or land use history
- Plan for at least one composite sample per 2-5 acres for uniform areas
- Increase sampling density in areas with obvious variations
- Note GPS coordinates for each sampling location for future reference

**Timing considerations:**
- Avoid sampling immediately after fertilizer application or heavy rain
- Best timing is typically spring or fall when soil is workable
- Maintain consistent timing for annual follow-up tests

### Step 2: Collect Soil Samples

**Equipment needed:**
- Soil probe or auger (stainless steel preferred)
- Clean plastic buckets (one per composite sample)
- Sealable plastic bags or sample containers
- Labels and permanent markers
- GPS device or smartphone with GPS
- Field notebook for observations
- Camera for documentation

**Collection process:**
- Remove surface debris (leaves, grass) from sampling point
- Take samples from consistent depth (typically 0-6 inches for most purposes)
- For each composite sample, collect 10-15 subsamples in a zigzag pattern
- Mix subsamples thoroughly in clean bucket
- Transfer approximately 1-2 cups to labeled container
- Record location, depth, date, and any visual observations

**Visual assessment while sampling:**
- Note soil color (indicates organic matter and drainage)
- Observe soil texture (sand, silt, clay proportions)
- Check for compaction layers
- Look for earthworms and other soil organisms
- Note any unusual odors (may indicate contamination or anaerobic conditions)
- Document root presence and condition

### Step 3: Conduct Laboratory Analysis

**Essential tests:**
- **Macro-nutrients:** Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K)
- **Secondary nutrients:** Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg), Sulfur (S)
- **Micronutrients:** Iron, Zinc, Manganese, Copper, Boron (if indicated)
- **Soil pH:** Critical for nutrient availability
- **Organic matter content:** Indicator of soil health
- **Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC):** Soil's ability to hold nutrients

**Optional advanced tests:**
- Heavy metal screening (if contamination suspected)
- Soil respiration (biological activity indicator)
- Mycorrhizal fungi colonization rates
- Soil microbial biomass
- Aggregate stability
- Infiltration rate
- Electrical conductivity (salinity)

**Laboratory selection:**
- Use certified soil testing laboratories
- University extension services often provide affordable testing
- Specify "restoration" or "ecological" testing package if available
- Request interpretation guides with results

### Step 4: Perform Field Assessments

**Soil structure test:**
- Dig a 12-inch deep hole
- Examine soil profile for distinct layers
- Note compaction zones or restrictive layers
- Take photos for documentation

**Infiltration test:**
- Dig a small hole (6 inches deep, 4 inches diameter)
- Fill with water and let it drain completely
- Refill and time how long it takes to drain
- Good drainage: 1-3 inches per hour
- Poor drainage: less than 0.5 inches per hour

**Jar test (texture analysis):**
- Fill jar 1/3 with soil, 2/3 with water
- Shake vigorously for 1 minute
- Let settle for 24 hours
- Sand settles first (bottom), silt middle, clay top
- Calculate percentages to determine soil texture class

**Earthworm count:**
- Dig a 1-foot cube of soil
- Count earthworms visible in the sample
- Healthy soil: 10+ earthworms per cubic foot
- Note different species and life stages

### Step 5: Assess Biological Activity

**Simple indicators:**
- Presence and diversity of soil invertebrates
- Fungal mycelium visible on organic matter
- Speed of organic matter decomposition
- Root health and branching patterns
- Soil smell (healthy soil has earthy, pleasant odor)

**Slake test (aggregate stability):**
- Place dry soil clod in water
- Watch how quickly it breaks apart
- Stable aggregates = good soil structure
- Rapid slaking = poor structure, low organic matter

### Step 6: Document Contamination History

**Research site history:**
- Previous land uses (agriculture, industry, residential)
- Known spills or contamination events
- Proximity to contamination sources
- Historical maps and records

**If contamination suspected:**
- Test for specific contaminants based on history
- Consider heavy metals, pesticides, petroleum products
- Consult environmental professionals
- May need specialized sampling protocols

### Step 7: Compile and Interpret Results

**Create comprehensive soil profile:**
- Map showing sampling locations and results
- Summary table of all test results
- Comparison to regional benchmarks for healthy soil
- Identification of deficiencies and problem areas
- Photos and visual documentation

**Interpretation assistance:**
- Work with soil scientist or agronomist
- Consult extension service interpretation guides
- Consider hiring restoration ecologist for complex sites
- Compare results to reference sites if available

- Problem: Comprehensive testing can be expensive
- Solution: Prioritize essential tests first; use extension service labs; consider pooling samples from similar areas; plan multi-year testing schedule

**Challenge 3: Contamination Discovered**
- Problem: Testing reveals unexpected contamination
- Solution: Halt other work; consult environmental professionals; develop remediation plan; consider phytoremediation or mycoremediation; may need regulatory notification

**Challenge 4: No Local Soil Testing Labs**
- Problem: Nearest certified lab is far away

## 📈 Understanding Soil Test Results

**Key Parameters Explained:**

**pH (0-14 scale):**
- 6.0-7.5: Optimal for most plants
- Below 6.0: Acidic (may need lime)
- Above 7.5: Alkaline (may need sulfur)
- Affects nutrient availability significantly

**Organic Matter:**
- 2-3%: Minimum for health
- 5-8%: Good for restoration
- 10%+: Excellent (typical of undisturbed soil)
- Higher = better water retention and fertility

**Nutrient Levels:**
- Low/Medium/High ratings typically provided
- Optimal levels depend on target ecosystem
- Native systems often need lower nutrients than agriculture
- Balance more important than absolute levels

**CEC (Cation Exchange Capacity):**
- Measures nutrient-holding capacity
- Higher = better nutrient retention
- Affected by clay content and organic matter
- Important for understanding fertilizer needs

## 🌍 Climate & Regional Considerations

**Arid Regions:**
- Test for salinity and alkalinity
- Water-holding capacity critical
- Organic matter especially important

**Humid Regions:**
- Test for acidity
- Drainage assessment crucial
- Heavy metal accumulation more common

**Agricultural Conversion:**
- Test for pesticide residues
- Expect nutrient imbalances
- Compaction very common

**Urban/Industrial Sites:**
- Comprehensive contamination screening essential
- May have foreign fill material
- pH often highly altered
