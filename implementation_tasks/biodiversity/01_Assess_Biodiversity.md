# Task 1: Assess Biodiversity

← Back to [[00_Biodiversity_Overview|Biodiversity Overview]]

---

## Purpose

A comprehensive biodiversity assessment establishes the baseline for conservation efforts. Understanding what species are present, their populations, and their habitats allows you to track progress and make informed management decisions.

---

## What You'll Do

Conduct systematic surveys to identify all species (flora and fauna) present in the area, document their population sizes and habitats, and identify species that are missing but historically present.

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Assemble Expert Team

**Required Expertise:**
- Conservation biologist or ecologist (lead)
- Botanist (plant identification)
- Zoologist or wildlife specialist
- Ornithologist (birds)
- Entomologist (insects) - optional but recommended
- Local naturalists (traditional knowledge)

**Budget:** €2,000-5,000 for expert consultations

### 2. Conduct Flora Survey

**Methods:**
- Systematic plot surveys
- Transect walks
- Species lists by habitat type
- Herbarium specimens (if needed)

**Document:**
- All vascular plants (trees, shrubs, herbs)
- Native vs. non-native status
- Abundance (rare, occasional, common, abundant)
- Habitat preferences
- Conservation status

### 3. Conduct Fauna Surveys

**Mammals:**
- Camera traps (60-90 day deployment)
- Track and sign surveys
- Hair/scat collection for DNA analysis
- Night spotlighting
- Community interviews

**Birds:**
- Point count surveys (dawn chorus)
- Breeding bird surveys (spring/summer)
- Migration surveys (autumn/spring)
- Nest searches
- Audio recordings

**Reptiles & Amphibians:**
- Visual encounter surveys
- Aquatic surveys (dip netting)
- Artificial cover objects
- Night surveys with flashlights

**Invertebrates:**
- Pitfall traps
- Sweep netting
- Light traps (moths and other insects)
- Aquatic sampling
- Focus on indicator groups (butterflies, dragonflies)

### 4. Habitat Mapping

**Identify and Map:**
- Woodland areas (canopy cover, species composition)
- Grassland types
- Wetlands and water bodies
- Rock outcrops and cliffs
- Disturbed areas
- Transition zones (ecotones)

**For Each Habitat:**
- Extent (area in hectares)
- Condition (excellent, good, fair, poor)
- Dominant species
- Key wildlife using habitat
- Threats present

### 5. Historical Research

**Investigate Past Biodiversity:**
- Historical species records
- Museum specimens
- Scientific publications
- Local knowledge (elders)
- Old photographs or surveys
- Land use history

**Identify Missing Species:**
- Which species have disappeared?
- Why did they disappear?
- Could they return naturally?
- Would reintroduction be appropriate?

### 6. Identify Threats

**Document Current Threats:**
- Invasive species presence
- Habitat degradation
- Human disturbance
- Pollution sources
- Climate impacts
- Wildlife conflicts

### 7. Data Analysis

**Compile Results:**
- Complete species list with scientific names
- Population estimates (or abundance categories)
- Species richness by habitat
- Diversity indices (Shannon, Simpson)
- Rare/threatened species
- Indicator species present/absent

**Compare to Reference Sites:**
- Similar nearby habitats
- Protected areas
- Historical data
- Regional species pools

## Deliverables

✅ **Complete Species List:** All flora and fauna documented

✅ **Habitat Map:** Showing types, extent, and condition

✅ **Baseline Report:** Comprehensive assessment document

✅ **Photo Documentation:** Species and habitats

✅ **Priority Species List:** Rare, threatened, or key species

✅ **Threat Assessment:** Current challenges to biodiversity

✅ **Recommendations:** Initial conservation priorities

---

## Timeline

**Duration:** 4-8 weeks minimum (seasonal surveys require full year)

**Optimal Approach:**
- Initial rapid assessment: 2-4 weeks
- Seasonal follow-ups: Throughout Year 1
- Comprehensive report: After 12 months

---

## Technology Support

- Camera traps → [[../../21_Technology_Integration|Technology]]
- GPS for mapping
- Identification apps (iNaturalist, eBird)
- Audio recorders for bird/bat surveys

---

## Success Indicators

✅ Comprehensive species list (target: 50+ species minimum)
✅ All major taxonomic groups surveyed
✅ Habitat map completed
✅ Baseline data collected for future comparison
✅ Expert validation of results

---

## Next Steps

Once baseline is established:

*Remember: This baseline is critical—it's what you'll measure all future progress against.*
