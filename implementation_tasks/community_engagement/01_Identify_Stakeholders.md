# Identify Stakeholders

← Back to [[README|Implementation Tasks]] | [[00_Community_Engagement_Overview|Community Engagement Overview]]

---

## 📋 Purpose

Stakeholder identification is the foundational step in community engagement. Before you can effectively communicate, involve, or share benefits with your community, you must first understand who that community is. Stakeholders are individuals, groups, or organizations that can affect or be affected by your restoration project—and identifying them comprehensively ensures no one is overlooked or surprised. Poor stakeholder identification leads to opposition, delays, conflicts, and project failure. Thorough identification reveals opportunities for partnership, uncovers potential concerns early, and maps the social landscape that will ultimately determine your project's success or failure.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify all individuals and groups affected by or interested in the project
- Understand diverse stakeholder perspectives and priorities
- Map relationships, power dynamics, and influence networks
- Prioritize engagement efforts based on stakeholder analysis
- Uncover potential allies, partners, and champions
- Anticipate sources of opposition or concern
- Ensure no critical voices are overlooked
- Create foundation for targeted, effective engagement
- Build comprehensive stakeholder database for ongoing use

## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Understand Stakeholder Categories

**Stakeholders fall into several overlapping categories:**

**Primary Stakeholders (Directly Affected):**
- People living adjacent to or near restoration site
- Current land users (farmers, ranchers, recreationists)
- Communities dependent on ecosystem services from site
- Indigenous peoples with traditional ties to land
- Those whose livelihoods depend on site resources

**Secondary Stakeholders (Indirectly Affected):**
- Broader community members in watershed or region
- Businesses that might benefit or lose from changes
- Regional residents who use area occasionally
- Future generations (represented by youth, educators)

**Key Influencers:**
- Local political leaders and officials
- Community leaders (formal and informal)
- Media representatives
- Religious or spiritual leaders
- Respected elders or long-time residents
- Environmental advocates and activists

**Institutional Stakeholders:**
- Government agencies (local, regional, national)
- NGOs and conservation organizations
- Academic and research institutions
- Funders and donors
- Private sector companies
- Professional associations

**Internal Stakeholders:**
- Your project team and staff

### Step 2: Use Multiple Identification Methods

**Desktop Research:**
- Review census and demographic data
- Study local government records and meeting minutes
- Search local news archives for relevant issues
- Review social media and community forums
- Examine previous environmental impact assessments
- Research land ownership and use records
- Review maps showing adjacent properties and uses

**Ask Around (Snowball Method):**
- Start with people you know
- Ask each person: "Who else should I talk to?"
- Follow recommendations systematically
- Keep asking until names repeat frequently
- Particularly effective for finding informal leaders

**Attend Community Events:**
- Town meetings and public forums
- Farmers markets and community gatherings
- School events and festivals
- Religious services and cultural events
- Local organization meetings
- Observe who people listen to and respect

**Drive/Walk the Area:**
- Visit the site and surrounding areas
- Notice homes, businesses, farms nearby
- Observe how people use the land
- Look for signs of community gathering places
- Note recreation areas, trails, access points
- Identify visual lines of sight to site

**Partner with Local Organizations:**
- Contact existing community groups
- Ask for their stakeholder lists
- Request introductions to key people
- Learn about community structure and dynamics
- Understand existing networks and relationships

**Use Institutional Contacts:**
- Local government planning departments
- Extension offices and agricultural agencies
- School districts and libraries
- Chambers of commerce
- Conservation districts
- Historical societies

**Social Network Analysis:**
- Map who is connected to whom
- Identify central connectors and influencers
- Understand information flow patterns
- Find bridge people between different groups

### Step 3: Create Comprehensive Stakeholder List

**Develop detailed database including:**

**For Individuals:**
- Name and title
- Organization/affiliation (if any)
- Contact information (phone, email, address)
- Role/interest in project
- Influence level and networks
- Preferred communication method
- Language preference
- Cultural considerations
- Accessibility needs

- Resources and capacity
- Relationship to other stakeholders
- History with similar projects
- Potential role in project

**Example Database Structure:**
```
Name: Maria Gonzalez
Role: Landowner, adjacent property
Organization: None (private individual)
Contact: 555-1234, mgonzalez@email.com
Interest: Concerned about water runoff onto her land
Influence: Medium - respected long-time resident
Language: Spanish preferred
Concerns: Property values, water issues
Opportunities: Possible partner if concerns addressed
Priority: High - directly affected
Engagement Plan: Early one-on-one meeting
```

**Tools for Tracking:**
- Spreadsheet (Excel, Google Sheets): Simple, accessible
- CRM software (Salesforce, HubSpot): More robust, expensive
- Contact management apps: Medium complexity
- Database software: Custom solutions
- Even paper files work if organized well

### Step 4: Conduct Stakeholder Analysis

**Power-Interest Grid:**

Plot each stakeholder on grid:
- **X-axis:** Level of interest (Low → High)
- **Y-axis:** Level of power/influence (Low → High)

**Four Quadrants:**

**High Power, High Interest (Manage Closely):**
- Most critical stakeholders
- Deep engagement essential
- Key decision makers
- Strong influence on project success
- *Strategy:* Collaborate closely, frequent communication

**High Power, Low Interest (Keep Satisfied):**
- Can impact project but may not be engaged
- Important to keep informed and content
- Could become more interested if issues arise
- *Strategy:* Regular updates, address concerns promptly

**Low Power, High Interest (Keep Informed):**
- Care deeply but limited influence
- Often willing volunteers and supporters
- Can become vocal advocates or opponents
- *Strategy:* Regular communication, meaningful involvement

**Low Power, Low Interest (Monitor):**
- Minimal engagement needed
- Keep on radar for changes
- May become more interested over time
- *Strategy:* General communications, monitor

**Influence-Impact Analysis:**

Consider:
- **Influence:** Ability to affect project (High/Medium/Low)
- **Impact:** How much project affects them (High/Medium/Low)

**High Influence, High Impact:** Top priority - closest collaboration
**High Influence, Low Impact:** Important allies or potential blockers
**Low Influence, High Impact:** Ensure their voices heard despite limited power
**Low Influence, Low Impact:** General communication sufficient

### Step 5: Map Relationships and Dynamics

**Stakeholder Relationship Mapping:**

**Create visual map showing:**
- All key stakeholders (boxes or circles)
- Connections between them (lines)
- Nature of relationships:
  - Solid line: Strong relationship
  - Dashed line: Weak relationship
  - Line with X: Conflict or tension
  - Different colors: Different types of relationships

**Identify:**
- **Clusters:** Groups of connected stakeholders
- **Central connectors:** People who link many others
- **Isolated stakeholders:** Those poorly connected
- **Bridge people:** Connect different groups/clusters
- **Conflict lines:** Where tensions exist

**Power Dynamics:**
- Who has formal authority (government, landowners)?
- Who has informal influence (respected community members)?
- Who controls resources (money, land, water)?
- Who has legitimacy (traditional rights, expertise)?
- How is power distributed across groups (age, gender, ethnicity, class)?

**Historical Context:**
- Previous conflicts or collaborations?
- Trust or mistrust of outside organizations?
- Past experiences with conservation projects?
- Historical injustices or grievances?
- Long-standing community divisions?

### Step 6: Identify Specific Stakeholder Groups

**By Geographic Proximity:**
- **Immediate neighbors:** <0.5 mile radius
- **Near neighbors:** 0.5-2 mile radius
- **Regional community:** 2-10 miles
- **Watershed community:** Entire watershed
- **Broader public:** Anyone who might visit or benefit

**By Land Use:**
- Farmers and ranchers
- Residential property owners
- Commercial property owners
- Recreational users (hikers, hunters, fishers, bikers)
- Water users (irrigation, domestic, industrial)
- Timber or resource extractors

**By Demographics:**
- Age groups (elders, adults, youth, children)
- Ethnic and cultural communities
- Income levels and economic classes
- Language groups
- People with disabilities
- Gender-specific groups (if relevant)

**By Organizational Type:**
- Government (municipal, county, state, federal)
- Schools and educational institutions
- Environmental and conservation groups
- Agricultural organizations
- Business and economic development groups
- Social service organizations
- Faith-based organizations
- Cultural and historical societies
- Recreational clubs and associations
- Homeowners associations

**By Interest Area:**

- Wildlife enthusiasts
- Climate action groups
- Property rights advocates
- Economic development proponents
- Social justice organizations
- Public health professionals
- Tourism and recreation businesses

### Step 7: Prioritize for Engagement

**Not all stakeholders require same level of engagement. Prioritize based on:**

**High Priority (Intensive Engagement):**
- Directly affected by project (land, livelihood, wellbeing)
- High power to support or block project
- Essential partners for implementation
- Legal or ethical obligation to engage (e.g., Indigenous rights)
- Potential for significant conflict
- Critical for long-term stewardship

**Medium Priority (Regular Engagement):**
- Indirectly affected
- Moderate influence or interest
- Potential partners or supporters
- Important for broader buy-in
- Part of key networks

**Lower Priority (General Communication):**
- Minimal impact from project
- Low influence and interest currently
- Could become more interested later
- Keep informed but don't require intensive engagement

**Priority Matrix Example:**
```
PRIORITY 1 (Intensive - 15 stakeholders):
- 5 adjacent landowners
- 3 Indigenous community leaders
- 2 local government officials
- 3 environmental groups (partners)
- 2 major water users

PRIORITY 2 (Regular - 30 stakeholders):
- 10 community organization leaders
- 8 business owners in region
- 5 recreational user groups
- 4 regional government agencies
- 3 media contacts

PRIORITY 3 (General - 100+ stakeholders):
- General public in watershed
- Broader environmental community
- Academic institutions
- Distant government agencies
- Occasional visitors
```

### Step 8: Understand Diverse Perspectives

**For each key stakeholder, document:**

**Their Interests:**
- What do they care most about?
- What are their priorities and values?
- What motivates them?

**Their Concerns:**
- What might they worry about?
- What could they oppose?
- What are their fears or anxieties?

**Their Needs:**
- What would they want from project?
- How could project benefit them?
- What would make them supporters?

**Their Resources:**
- What can they contribute (knowledge, labor, funding, influence)?
- What capacity do they have to participate?
- What constraints limit their involvement?

**Their Communication Preferences:**
- How do they prefer to receive information?
- What times and formats work for them?
- What language do they use?
- What level of detail do they want?

**Example Stakeholder Profile:**
```
Stakeholder: Local Farmers Association
Interest: Protecting agricultural water rights
Concerns: 
- Restoration might reduce irrigation water
- Regulations restricting land use
- Increased wildlife damaging crops
Needs: 
- Assurance of water availability
- Support for wildlife-friendly farming
