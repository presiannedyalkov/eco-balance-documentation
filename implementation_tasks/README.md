## 🔄 Integration Principles

### 1. **Everything Connects**
Restoration is not a collection of separate tasks but an integrated system where each action affects others:

- **Soil → Water → Plants → Wildlife:** Classic ecological succession
- **Community → All Phases:** People enable and sustain everything
- **Monitoring → Adaptation → Improvement:** Continuous learning loop
- **Site → Species → Management:** Context determines strategy

### 2. **Sequence and Timing**
While all phases are interconnected, some logical sequencing exists:

**Early Phase (Months 1-6):**
- Site selection and assessment
- Stakeholder identification and initial engagement
- Baseline monitoring (biodiversity, soil, water)
- Planning and design

**Implementation Phase (Months 6-24):**
- Site preparation and infrastructure
- Planting and restoration activities
- Community involvement programs
- Educational initiatives
- Ongoing monitoring

**Stewardship Phase (Year 2+):**
- Maintenance and management
- Long-term monitoring
- Adaptive management
- Community ownership transition
- Benefit realization

### 3. **Adaptive Management**
All phases require continuous observation, learning, and adjustment:

```
PLAN → IMPLEMENT → MONITOR → EVALUATE → ADAPT → REPEAT
```

### 4. **Scale and Context**
The framework applies at multiple scales:

- **Small Urban Sites (< 1 acre):** All principles apply with simplified approaches
- **Medium Sites (1-50 acres):** Full framework implementation
- **Large Landscapes (50+ acres):** Phased approach with multiple teams
- **Regional Initiatives:** Coordination across multiple projects

### 5. **Resource Optimization**
Integrate activities to maximize efficiency:

- Community work days combine multiple tasks
- Monitoring covers multiple variables at once
- Educational programs teach multiple concepts
- Infrastructure serves multiple functions
- Staff expertise spans multiple areas
