## Bootstrap Phase (Months 1-12): Proof of Concept

**Goal:** Validate restoration approach at 1 hectare pilot scale

**This is Year 0** - proving the model before Phase 1 expansion. See:
- [[42_Next_Steps_90_Days|First 90 Days]]: Campaign & land acquisition
- [[43_Operations_Action_Plan|Operations Guide]]: Bootstrap operations
- [[44_Site_Selection_Land_Acquisition|Site Selection]]: Finding 1 ha site

**Bootstrap Success Metrics:**
- 1 hectare secured and operational
- 100-200 trees planted with 70%+ survival
- €20-30k Year 1 budget managed effectively
- Restoration methods documented
- Model proven viable for scaling

**After Bootstrap Success** → Phase 1 expansion begins (below)

## Expansion Strategy - Adaptive Framework

**Vision:** Scale restoration impact across Europe while maintaining quality and financial sustainability.

**Core Requirements:**
- Proven model at 1ha before expanding
- Financial sustainability at each scale
- Maintain founder control and vision
- Expansion only when capacity allows

### Option A: Stay at 1ha, Intensify (Low Risk)

**Cost:** €0-5k/year | **Timeline:** Year 1-5+ | **Risk:** Low

**Description:**
Perfect the model at 1ha, maximize biodiversity and learning without geographic expansion.

**Activities:**
- Dense planting with diverse native species (1,000-2,000 trees on 1ha)
- Extensive monitoring and documentation
- Host workshops and educational programs on-site
- Create showcase demonstration site
- Develop consulting services based on proven methods

**Pros:**
- Low cost and low complexity
- Deep learning and expertise development
- Perfect showcase for methodology
- Manageable workload for 1-2 people
- Lower risk, easier to maintain quality
- Can still generate meaningful revenue

**Cons:**
- Limited total ecological impact (just 1ha)
- May feel small or limiting long-term
- Revenue ceiling lower than larger operations
- Less visibility than multi-site projects
- Slower path to major influence

**Best If:**
- Risk-averse, want to perfect the craft
- Limited capital available for expansion
- Strong focus on education/consulting revenue
- Prefer depth over breadth of impact
- 1-2 person team without plans to scale team

**Financial Model:**
- **Revenue potential:** €20-40k/year
- **Sources:** Workshops (€10-15k), consulting (€10-15k), plant sales (€5-10k)
