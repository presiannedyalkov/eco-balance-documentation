## Risk Management Philosophy

**Every bold vision faces obstacles.** Effective risk management isn't about avoiding all risks—it's about:
- **Identifying** risks early
- **Assessing** likelihood and impact
- **Mitigating** through proactive strategies
- **Monitoring** and adjusting continuously

We plan for the best, prepare for the worst, and expect reality somewhere in between.
