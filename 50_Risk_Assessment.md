## Risk Management Philosophy

**Every bold vision faces obstacles.** Effective risk management isn't about avoiding all risks—it's about:
- **Identifying** risks early
- **Assessing** likelihood and impact
- **Mitigating** through proactive strategies
- **Monitoring** and adjusting continuously

We plan for the best, prepare for the worst, and expect reality somewhere in between.

**Likelihood:** Medium-High  
**Impact:** Critical  
**Priority:** 🔴 **CRITICAL**

### Specific Scenarios

**Year 1 Bootstrap Phase:**
- Personal savings insufficient
- Friends/family funding falls short

- Economic constraints delay launch

**Year 2+ Expansion Phase:**
- Grant applications rejected
- Corporate partners don't materialize
- Major donor prospects decline
- Cannot secure €250-500k for scaling
- Economic downturn reduces giving

### Consequences

- **DIY approach:** Founders do all work, no salaries
- **Phased investment:** Can start with €15-20k if needed
- **Use Year 1 pilot to de-risk Year 2+ fundraising**

**Year 2+ Expansion Risk Mitigation:**
- **Proven concept attracts investors:** Use Year 1 results
- **Start smaller if needed:** 3-5 hectares vs. 5-10
- **Defer non-essentials:** Can add technology later
