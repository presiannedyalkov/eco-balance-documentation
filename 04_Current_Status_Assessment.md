## 🚦 Readiness Assessment

### Critical Success Factors Check

**✅ READY:**
- Deep understanding of restoration science
- Clear differentiated vision
- Systematic planning approach
- Financial sustainability mindset
- Community-first values

**⚠️ IN PROGRESS:**
- Legal structure (researched, not executed)
- Funding strategy (outlined, not activated)
- Site criteria (defined, not applied)

**❌ NOT READY:**
- Legal entity for fundraising
- Team for execution
- Capital for operations
- Land for restoration

---

## ⏱️ Timeline Reality Check

### Realistic Path to Bootstrap Operations (Year 1)

**Optimistic Scenario:** 6 months
- Month 1-2: Legal setup expedited, founders committed
- Month 2-3: Bootstrap funding (€20k-€30k) secured quickly
- Month 3-4: 1 hectare site acquired
- Month 5-6: First plantings completed, operations begun

**Realistic Scenario:** 9-12 months (Bootstrap approach)
- Month 1-3: Legal setup, founding team confirmed
- Month 3-6: Bootstrap funding gradually secured (€20k-€30k)
- Month 4-8: 1 hectare land search and acquisition
- Month 9-12: Plantings completed, proof of concept demonstrated

**Conservative Scenario:** 12-18 months
- Bootstrap funding comes slowly
- Land acquisition challenges
- Patient building approach
- Steady progress but slower

**Recommendation:** Plan for 9-12 months to Bootstrap launch. The Bootstrap approach significantly reduces timeline compared to seeking €250k+ upfront. Focus on proving concept first, then scaling.
