# 🎉 Release Notes - Version 2.0.0

**Release Date:** November 6, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Stable  
**Type:** MAJOR - Bootstrap Model Transformation  
**Code Name:** Bootstrap Model

---

## 🎯 Overview

Version 2.0.0 represents a **fundamental paradigm shift** from the aspirational Large-Scale Model to an immediately executable Bootstrap Model. This release transforms the entire project approach from "what we'd like to do if we had €500k-2M" to "exactly what we're doing with approximately €20-30k Year 1 budget range (varies by funding pathway and location)".

**What This Means:** The project is now immediately executable by solo founders or small teams, achievable with crowdfunding and bootstrap capital, and focused on proving the model before scaling.

---

## 🎉 Release Highlights

### Complete Methodology Transformation
Transformed from 10-30 hectare large-scale operations to a 1-hectare pilot approach (typically 0.5-1.5 hectares, final size depends on available land and budget). This makes the project immediately viable for founders without requiring significant capital investment.

### Bootstrap Technology Approach
Restructured from professional-grade systems (20 kW solar, Atmospheric Water Generators) to DIY-friendly essentials (3-5 kW solar range, rainwater harvesting, IBC tanks). Technology budget reduced from €30-50k to approximately €15-20k Year 1 essentials.

### Founder-Level Operations
Adapted business model from multi-phase expansion requiring significant capital to bootstrap funding via crowdfunding, sustainable from Year 1. Focus shifted from team building to founder execution (small founder team typically 1-2 people, may expand if additional committed founders join).

## 🎉 Closing Notes

Version 2.0.0 represents a fundamental shift in approach that makes the Eco Balance project immediately executable. By transforming from an aspirational Large-Scale Model to a realistic Bootstrap Model, we've created a pathway that solo founders and small teams can actually follow.

The Bootstrap Model doesn't abandon the long-term vision - it simply recognizes that proving the concept on a small scale is the most viable path forward. The three-layer framework (Vision/Reality/Planning) ensures that long-term aspirations like atmospheric water generation, wildlife reservoirs, and food forests remain part of the vision while keeping the immediate plan focused on what's achievable.

This release is the result of careful analysis, realistic assessment, and a commitment to making ecological restoration accessible to founders who want to make a difference now, not someday. We're excited to see what the Bootstrap Model enables.
