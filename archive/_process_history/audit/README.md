### COMPREHENSIVE_AUDIT_REPORT_draft_incomplete.md

**Archived:** November 7, 2025  
**Original Name:** COMPREHENSIVE_FINAL_AUDIT_REPORT.md  
**Original Location:** `_process/audit/`  
**Archived By:** Janitor (Task JAN-2025-11-06-002)

**Reason for Archival:**
This file was an incomplete draft version of the audit report. It contains only Steps 1 and 2 (Executive Summary and Phase Details) and ends with "Type 'continue' for Step 3", indicating it was never completed.

**Superseded By:**
`_process/audit/COMPREHENSIVE_AUDIT_REPORT.md` - The complete, authoritative audit report containing:
- Full executive summary
- Detailed phase-by-phase results (Phases A-F)
- Priority recommendations and action items
- Complete implementation guidance
- 376 lines vs 63 lines in the draft

**Historical Context:**
Both files are dated November 2, 2025, but the complete report was last modified on November 6, 2025, incorporating all findings and recommendations. The draft was likely created during an interactive audit session that was then superseded by the comprehensive final report.

**Status:**
- ✅ Authoritative version preserved in active location
- ✅ Draft version archived for historical reference
- ✅ No unique content lost
