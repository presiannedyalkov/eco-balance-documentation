## 🔄 What Happened to These Files

On October 20-25, 2025, these comprehensive documents were refactored into a structured knowledge management system:

**Before (Pre-v1.0.0):**
- 3 large comprehensive documents
- Difficult to navigate
- Hard to update specific sections
- No version control
- Limited cross-referencing

**After (v1.0.0):**
- 66 focused, interconnected documents
- Easy navigation with wiki-style links
- Simple to update individual sections
- Professional version control system
- 200+ cross-references
- Obsidian knowledge graph

---

## 📖 Why Keep These?

These documents are preserved for:

1. **Historical Reference** - See how the project evolved
2. **Backup** - Original source material preserved
3. **Comparison** - Understand what changed and why
4. **Context** - Full history of documentation development
5. **Archival Completeness** - Nothing lost in the refactoring

## 🚀 Using Current Documentation

**Don't use these files for current work!**

Instead, use:
- [[../../00_Eco_Balance_Hub|Eco Balance Hub]] - Main navigation
- Strategic documents (01-70) in root directory
- Implementation tasks in implementation_tasks/
- [[../../VERSION|Current Version]] - v1.0.0
- [[../../CHANGELOG|Changelog]] - What's changed

---

## 📊 Refactoring Details

**Process documented in:**
- [[../../_process/refactoring/README_Refactor_Summary|Refactor Summary]]
- [[../_process_history/|Process History]]
- [[../../_versions/v1.0.0/RESTRUCTURE_PROPOSAL|Restructure Proposal]]

**Results:**
- From 3 files → 66 files
- From ~150 pages → ~700 pages (with more detail)
- From 0 cross-refs → 200+ cross-refs
- From no version control → Full semantic versioning
