### Pre-v1.0.0 Documents

Contains the original monolithic planning documents that were refactored into the v1.0.0 structured documentation system (October 2025):

- Eco_Balance_Executive_Summary.md
- Eco_Balance_Strategic_Analysis_Roadmap.md
- COMPLETION_REPORT_OCT_24_2025.md (original)

These files are preserved for historical reference and comparison but should not be used for current work.

- DOCUMENTATION_COMPLETE_FINAL.md - Early completion summary
- INTEGRATION_ASSESSMENT_SUMMARY.md - Initial integration assessment

**Naming convention:**
- Create version-specific folders: `pre-vX.X.X/`
- Or thematic folders: `_process_history/`
- Keep original filenames for traceability

### Archive Guidelines

**DO archive:**
- Superseded comprehensive documents
- Old process documentation
- Historical completion reports
