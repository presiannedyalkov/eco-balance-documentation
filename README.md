## 📖 About This Repository

This repository contains the complete documentation for the **Eco Balance** project - an initiative to restore degraded ecosystems in Europe through evidence-based, community-engaged, financially sustainable environmental restoration.

### Project Vision

Create a **habitat for wildlife** and **restore land to become a shelter and sanctuary for wildlife**. Through different trees, plants, mushrooms, and diverse areas, we promote different habitats and increase biodiversity. This is our primary purpose - to provide sanctuary and shelter for wildlife in the face of climate change and mass extinction.

**Current Status:** Exploration Phase - We're exploring pathways forward, no commitments made yet.

## 📂 Documentation Structure

### Two Documentation Locations

This repository contains documentation in two locations:

1. **Root Directory** (`00_Eco_Balance_Hub.md`, `strategic/` folder)
   - Original source files with Obsidian-style links
   - Strategic documents in `strategic/` folder
   - Restoration playbook in `strategic/restoration_playbook/`
   - May be used with Obsidian or other markdown tools

2. **`docs/` Directory** (Docusaurus site)
   - Organized in subdirectories for the public website
   - Uses standard markdown links
   - Contains synced content from root files
   - **This is the source for the Docusaurus website**

**⚠️ Important:** 
- **Root files are the source of truth** - Edit files in root or `strategic/` folder
- **`docs/` files are synced** - Run `node scripts/sync-docs.js` after editing root files
- **Restoration playbook** is synced from `strategic/restoration_playbook/` to `docs/restoration-playbook/`

See [DOCUMENTATION_STRUCTURE.md](_process/documentation/DOCUMENTATION_STRUCTURE.md) for details on the sync process.
