### 📋 Understanding the Checks

#### Security Checks Explained

**CodeQL Security Scanning:**
- **What it does:** Analyzes your code statically (without running it) to find security vulnerabilities and coding errors
- **What it finds:**
  - **High severity:** SQL injection, XSS vulnerabilities, insecure URL handling, command injection
  - **Medium severity:** Log injection, incomplete sanitization, path traversal risks
  - **Low/Note:** Unused code, code quality issues, best practice violations
- **How to read results:**
  - Click the badge or "View All Alerts" link to see the Security tab
  - Alerts are organized by severity (High → Medium → Low → Note)
  - Each alert shows: file location, issue type, and recommended fix
  - **Green badge** = workflow ran successfully (may still have alerts)
  - **Check the Security tab** for actual alert counts
- **When to act:** Review High/Medium alerts immediately, Low/Note can be addressed over time

**Dependabot Security:**
- **What it does:** Scans your `package.json` and `package-lock.json` against GitHub's vulnerability database
- **What it finds:** Known security vulnerabilities in npm packages (CVEs)
- **How it works:**
  - Automatically creates PRs for security updates when available
  - Alerts you when new vulnerabilities are discovered in existing packages
  - Can be configured to auto-merge minor/patch updates
- **How to read results:**
  - **Security tab** shows all open vulnerability alerts
  - **Dependabot PRs** show available updates (filter by `label:dependencies`)
  - Severity levels: Critical, High, Moderate, Low
- **When to act:** Critical/High should be addressed ASAP, Moderate/Low within a reasonable timeframe

#### Quality Checks Explained

**Lighthouse CI:**
- **Performance:** Measures how fast your site loads and becomes interactive
- **Accessibility:** Checks if your site is usable by people with disabilities
- **Best Practices:** Validates modern web standards (HTTPS, no console errors, etc.)
- **SEO:** Evaluates search engine optimization
- **Scores:** 0-100, with color coding (🟢 90+, 🟡 75-89, 🟠 50-74, 🔴 <50)

**Link Checking:**
- Verifies all external links in markdown files are accessible
- Reports broken links, timeouts, and redirects
- Non-blocking: won't fail the build, but alerts you to fix broken links

**Spell Check:**
- Scans all markdown files for spelling errors
- Uses custom dictionary (`.cspell.json`) for project-specific terms
- Non-blocking: alerts you to typos but doesn't block deployment

**Markdown Linting:**
- Validates markdown formatting consistency
- Checks for style issues (line length, heading spacing, etc.)
- Non-blocking: helps maintain consistent documentation style

## 📖 About This Repository

This repository contains the complete documentation for the **Eco Balance** project - an initiative to restore degraded ecosystems in Europe through evidence-based, community-engaged, financially sustainable environmental restoration.

### Project Vision

Create a **habitat for wildlife** and **restore land to become a shelter and sanctuary for wildlife**. Through different trees, plants, mushrooms, and diverse areas, we promote different habitats and increase biodiversity. This is our primary purpose - to provide sanctuary and shelter for wildlife in the face of climate change and mass extinction.

**Current Status:** Exploration Phase - We're exploring pathways forward, no commitments made yet.

## 📂 Documentation Structure

### Two Documentation Locations

This repository contains documentation in two locations:

1. **Root Directory** (`00_Eco_Balance_Hub.md`, `strategic/` folder)
   - Original source files with Obsidian-style links
   - Strategic documents in `strategic/` folder
   - Restoration playbook in `strategic/restoration_playbook/`
   - May be used with Obsidian or other markdown tools

2. **`docs/` Directory** (Docusaurus site)
   - Organized in subdirectories for the public website
   - Uses standard markdown links
   - Contains synced content from root files
   - **This is the source for the Docusaurus website**

**⚠️ Important:** 
- **Root files are the source of truth** - Edit files in root or `strategic/` folder
- **`docs/` files are synced** - Run `node scripts/sync-docs.js` after editing root files
- **Restoration playbook** is synced from `strategic/restoration_playbook/` to `docs/restoration-playbook/`

See [DOCUMENTATION_STRUCTURE.md](_process/documentation/DOCUMENTATION_STRUCTURE.md) for details on the sync process.
