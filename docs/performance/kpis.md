# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) - Adaptive Framework

**← Back to [Project Hub](/docs/intro)**

---

## KPI Adaptive Framework

### Vision: Evidence-Based Impact Measurement

**What We Want to Achieve**:
- Track meaningful ecological restoration progress
- Demonstrate credible impact to funders and community
- Enable data-driven improvement decisions
- Build transparency and accountability
- Support research and knowledge sharing

**Core Requirements** (non-negotiable):
- **Basic ecological tracking**: Tree counts, survival rates, visual documentation (photos/video)
- **Financial transparency**: Revenue, expenses, cash position
- **Honest reporting**: No inflated or unverifiable claims
- **Founder-manageable**: Metrics must be collectible without overwhelming limited capacity
- **Cost-appropriate**: Monitoring costs match available budget (not spending €5k on monitoring when total budget is €10k)

**Reality Check**: KPI complexity and comprehensiveness must match budget, capacity, and partnerships available. Year 1 minimal budget = minimal metrics. Year 3 with university partnership = comprehensive metrics.

---

## 📊 Tiered KPI System: Budget-Adaptive Monitoring

### Tier 1: Essential Baseline (Always Track)

**Budget Required**: €0-500/year (founder time + basic tools)
**Who Collects**: Founders/volunteers
**Equipment**: Smartphone camera, measuring tape, spreadsheet

**Metrics**:

**Ecological:**
- **Trees Planted (cumulative)**: Count all trees planted
- **Tree Survival Rate (%)**: Annual survival check (count living vs planted)
- **Visual Documentation**: Monthly photos from fixed points, quarterly video updates
- **Species Count**: Number of different species planted
- **Observable Biodiversity**: Bird species seen, insect presence (basic observation)

**Financial:**
- **Total Revenue (€)**: All income sources
- **Total Expenses (€)**: All costs
- **Cash Reserves (€)**: Bank balance
- **Revenue by Source (%)**: Breakdown (grants, donations, earned, etc.)

**Social:**
- **Volunteer Hours**: Time contributed by volunteers
- **Community Events (#)**: Workshops, tours, volunteer days held
- **People Reached**: Rough count of participants/visitors

**Operations:**

- 6+ native species
- Monthly photo documentation
- €15-30k revenue tracked
- 50-200 people reached
- 100-500 volunteer hours

**Why This Tier Always**: Even with zero budget, we can count trees, track money, and take photos. This is the non-negotiable minimum for credibility.

---

### Tier 2: Important Verification (If Budget Allows)

- pH stabilized in optimal range (6.0-7.5 for most species)
- Water quality "good" (safe, low turbidity)
- 30-50% canopy cover
- 30-50+ species documented (plants, birds, insects)
- 60%+ donor retention
- €5-10 cost per tree
- 7+/10 community satisfaction

**Decision Criteria - Add Tier 2 if**:
1. Annual budget ≥€40k (can afford €1-3k monitoring without compromising operations)
2. Grant specifically requires this level of monitoring
3. Partnership with university/research institution provides lab access at low/no cost
4. Seeking carbon credits or other verification requiring soil/biodiversity data

**Current Status**: Tier 2 deferred until budget allows or partnership provides resources. Target: Add by Year 2-3 if crowdfunding/grants succeed.

---

### Tier 3: Advanced Research (If Partnership/Grant Funded)

- 50%+ increase in microbial biomass
- 50%+ reduction in erosion rate
- 30-150 tons CO₂ sequestered (verified)
- Carbon credits issued (first batch)
- 2-3°C microclimate cooling effect
- Peer-reviewed publication (1-2 papers)
- Economic multiplier 1.5x
- Independent financial audit passed

**Decision Criteria - Add Tier 3 if**:
1. University partnership provides lab access, student researchers, equipment (often €0 cost to us)
2. Major grant (€50k+) specifically funds comprehensive monitoring
3. Carbon credit project requires verified data (cost is investment for credit revenue)
4. Research publication opportunity with academic partners
5. Funder requires independent audit (large grants, foundations)

**Trigger to Implement**:
- University partnership signed → Initiate Tier 3 ecological metrics within 3 months
- €50k+ grant awarded → Budget €5-10k for monitoring in grant proposal
- Carbon credit revenue >€10k/year potential → Invest €5-15k in verification (ROI positive)

**Current Status**: Tier 3 deferred pending partnership or major funding. Actively networking with universities for collaboration. Target: Establish partnership by Year 2-3.

**Adaptation Note**: Tier 3 is aspirational, not assumed. Only implement when resources available through partnership or dedicated funding. Do NOT spend €10k on monitoring when operating budget is €20k - that's backwards.

→ Methods: Water Management

---

#### Biodiversity Metrics (Tier 1 + 2 + 3)

**Tier 1 (Always):**
- Species observed - simple list (birds, insects, mammals seen)
- Photo documentation - monthly wildlife photos
- Observable increase - "more birds than before" (qualitative)

**Tier 2 (€1-3k/year):**
- Species Richness (#) - systematic counts (time-intensive but €0)

- **Year 3 (Tier 2+3)**: 50-100+ species documented, 2-3 indicator species present, functional diversity measured if partnership

**Decision**: Tier 1-2 achievable with founder effort. Tier 3 only if university partnership or grant funds research.

→ Methods: Biodiversity Conservation

---

#### Climate Metrics (Tier 2 + 3, verification-dependent)

**Tier 1 (Basic Calculation):**
- Trees Planted × Species Factor = Estimated CO₂ Sequestration
  - Example: 1,000 trees × 10-30 kg CO₂/tree/year = 10-30 tons CO₂/year (rough estimate)
- Visual microclimate - "Site feels cooler, more humid than before" (qualitative)

**Tier 2 (€1-3k/year):**
- Carbon Sequestration Estimated (tons CO₂) - improved calculation based on species, age, growth rate
- Temperature monitoring - basic thermometers at site vs control (€50-200)

**Tier 3 (€5-15k/year):**
- Carbon Sequestration Verified (tons CO₂) - third-party verification (€2,000-5,000)
- Carbon Credits Generated (#) - certified credits issued (verification €5,000-15,000)
- Microclimate Monitoring - sensors (temperature, humidity) (€2,000-5,000)
- GHG Emissions Avoided (tons CO₂e) - verified methodology (€1,000-3,000)

**Realistic Carbon Sequestration** (depends on species, age, location):
- **1 hectare temperate forest (Germany)**: ~10-30 tons CO₂/year (young) → 50-100 tons/year (mature 20+ years)
- **1 hectare Mediterranean forest (Portugal)**: ~5-20 tons CO₂/year (young) → 30-80 tons/year (mature)
- **Year 1 (1 ha, new planting)**: 2-10 tons CO₂ (first year minimal, trees small)
- **Year 3 (1-3 ha, 3 years growth)**: 10-50 tons CO₂
- **Year 5 (3-5 ha, 5 years growth)**: 30-150 tons CO₂

**Original 500+ tons target context**: Would require ~20-50 hectares mature forest, NOT 1-5 hectares young restoration site. Be realistic.

**Decision**: Tier 1 rough estimates always. Tier 3 verification ONLY if pursuing carbon credit revenue (cost is investment for revenue) OR grant requires it.

**Trigger for Tier 3 Carbon**:
- Carbon credit revenue potential >€10k/year → Invest €5-15k verification (ROI positive)
- Grant requires verified carbon data → Include verification cost in grant budget
- Partnership with carbon credit program → Verification subsidized

**Current Status**: Tier 1 estimates only. Tier 3 verification deferred until carbon credit market opportunity or grant requirement. Target: Explore carbon credit programs Year 2-3.

- **Year 3**: 2-3 employees (€50-100k total wages depending on funding)
- **Year 4-5**: 3-5 employees (€100-200k total wages if revenue model working)

**Note on "€150k+ wages Year 3"**: Only realistic if €100-150k+ annual budget achieved. With bootstrap €30-50k budget, wages will be €30-60k total (1-2 people part-time/low salary). Be budget-realistic.

**Decision**: Track Tier 1 always (simple accounting). Tier 3 economic study only if required by major grant/foundation.

---

### Decision Criteria - Which Reporting Tier?

1. **Year 1-2 minimal budget (€15-40k)** → Tier 1 reporting (quarterly + annual)
2. **Year 2-3 moderate budget (€40-80k) + some capacity** → Tier 2 reporting (monthly + quarterly + annual)
3. **Year 3+ major funding (€80k+) + partnership** → Tier 3 reporting (comprehensive, verified, published)
4. **Grant requirement** → If grant requires specific reporting, budget for it in grant proposal
5. **Founder capacity** → Don't commit to weekly social media if founders already working 60hr/week - burnout risk

**Current Status**:
- **Committed**: Tier 1 reporting (quarterly email, annual report, monthly social media)
- **Target**: Add Tier 2 reporting by Year 2 if budget >€40k and capacity allows
- **Deferred**: Tier 3 reporting until partnership or major funding (Year 3+)

---

## 🔍 Third-Party Verification - When Required

**Tier 1 (Self-Reported, Always):**
- Internal documentation, founder-collected data
- Transparent but not independently verified
- Sufficient for small donors, F&F, small grants

**Tier 2 (Some Verification, Year 2+):**
- Lab tests (soil, water) from certified labs - provides third-party verification of those metrics
- Survey results from independent platform (Google Forms still self-administered but transparent)
- Financial records from accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero) - professional but not audited

**Tier 3 (Full Verification, Major Funding):**
- **Financial Audit** - independent CPA (€2,000-5,000/year) - required by:
  - Many grants >€50k
  - Foundations
  - Some government programs
  - **Decision**: Only do audit when funder requires OR budget >€100k/year (good governance)

  - **Decision**: Only invest if carbon credit revenue potential >€10k/year (ROI positive)
- **Environmental Impact Assessment** - professional evaluator - required by some major grants
  - **Decision**: Only if grant requires and grant budget includes this cost
- **Economic Impact Study** - professional economist (€5,000-10,000) - required by some regional/government funders
  - **Decision**: Only if funder requires and grant budget includes this cost

**Principle**: Trust but verify - but verification costs money. Only verify when:
1. Funder requires it (and ideally funds it)
2. ROI is positive (e.g., carbon credit revenue >verification cost)
3. Budget is large enough that audit is good governance (€100k+ → audit recommended)

**Current Status**: Self-reported Tier 1 metrics for Year 1-2. Add verification as budget/requirements dictate, not proactively.

## ⚠️ Red Flags & Adaptive Response

### Ecological Red Flags:

**Tier 1 (Can detect without special equipment):**
- **Survival rate &lt;70%** → RESPONSE: Review species selection, planting technique, watering, site conditions. Adapt immediately.
- **No observable biodiversity increase by Year 2** → RESPONSE: Add habitat features (brush piles, water sources, flowering plants). Reassess approach.
- **Soil visibly degrading (erosion, compaction)** → RESPONSE: Add mulch, ground cover, erosion control. Urgent action.

**Tier 2 (Need testing to detect):**
- **Soil organic carbon decreasing** → RESPONSE: Increase organic matter input (compost, mulch), review practices.
- **Water pH outside 6-9 range** → RESPONSE: Investigate contamination source, address if possible.

**Tier 3 (Need comprehensive testing):**
- **Microbial biomass decreasing** → RESPONSE: Research soil management, consult experts.

**Decision**: Respond to red flags at whatever tier you're monitoring. Don't ignore Tier 1 red flags waiting for Tier 3 data.

---

### Financial Red Flags:

**Tier 1 (Always monitor):**
- **Revenue &lt;50% of target for 2+ quarters** → RESPONSE:
  - Intensify fundraising (emergency mode)
  - Cut non-essential expenses
  - Revisit funding strategy, pivot to different pathway if needed
  - Adjust timeline (slow down if needed to maintain financial security)
- **Expenses >110% of budget for 2+ quarters** → RESPONSE:
  - Identify cost overruns, cut immediately
  - Reassess budget assumptions
  - Delay non-essential spending
- **Cash reserves &lt;1 month operating expenses** → RESPONSE:
  - **URGENT**: Emergency fundraising mode
  - Cut all non-essential spending immediately
  - Consider pausing expansion until reserves rebuild
  - Activate backup funding plan (e.g., ultra-lean bootstrap, founder contributions)
- **Administrative overhead >25%** → RESPONSE:
  - Review admin costs, cut where possible
  - Ensure spending focused on mission not overhead

**Tier 2 (If tracking):**
- **Donor retention &lt;50%** → RESPONSE: Improve donor communication, thank-yous, impact reporting
- **Grant success rate &lt;10%** → RESPONSE: Improve grant applications, seek feedback, target better-fit grants

**Adaptation Philosophy**: Financial red flags trigger immediate adaptation. If crowdfunding fails → pivot to grants. If grants slow → activate bootstrap plan. Always have Plan B.

---

### Social Red Flags:

**Tier 1:**
- **Volunteer participation declining** → RESPONSE: Survey volunteers, improve experience, adjust events
- **Low community engagement at events** → RESPONSE: Reassess event format, timing, communication

**Tier 2:**
- **Community satisfaction &lt;6/10** → RESPONSE: Immediate stakeholder meetings, understand concerns, adapt approach
- **Staff turnover >30%** → RESPONSE: Review working conditions, compensation, workload, team culture

**Decision**: Social health is crucial for long-term success. Address social red flags quickly even if Tier 1 data (qualitative feedback).

## 🏆 Success Celebration & Milestone Recognition

**When KPIs Met or Exceeded**:
1. **Recognize the team** - celebrate wins, acknowledge effort (low cost: team lunch, thank-you notes)
2. **Share externally** - build credibility through success stories (social media, newsletter, blog post)
3. **Adjust targets** - set new ambitious goals based on what's achievable
4. **Analyze what worked** - document success factors for replication
5. **Thank supporters** - let donors/volunteers know their contribution made the difference

**Milestone Celebrations (Tier 1, Always Do)**:
- **First 1,000 trees planted** - volunteer thank-you event, social media campaign
- **Year 1 complete** - annual report, founder reflection, supporter thank-you
- **First grant awarded** - announce publicly, thank grantor, share plans
- **80%+ survival rate** - celebrate ecological success, share methodology
- **Break-even month** (revenue ≥ expenses) - major financial milestone

**Principle**: Success breeds success. Momentum matters. Share wins to build credibility and attract more support.

## 📍 Current Status & Decision Timeline

### Committed Now (Tier 1):
- ✅ Track all Tier 1 metrics starting Day 1
- ✅ Quarterly email updates to supporters
- ✅ Annual impact report (5-10 pages, simple design)
- ✅ Monthly social media updates (photos + quick stats)
- ✅ Transparent financial reporting (revenue, expenses, reserves)

### Target by Year 2 (Tier 2):
- [ ] Add soil testing (€200-400/year) - by Month 12-18
- [ ] Add water quality testing (€100-200/year) - by Month 12-18
- [ ] Add community satisfaction survey (€0-100/year) - by Month 12
- [ ] Add drone/satellite canopy cover analysis (€200-500/year) - by Month 18-24
- [ ] Increase reporting to monthly newsletter - if capacity allows
- **Decision Trigger**: When annual budget ≥€40k → allocate €1-3k for Tier 2 monitoring

### Target by Year 3+ (Tier 3):
- [ ] Seek university partnership for advanced monitoring (€0 cost if partnership covers)
- [ ] Annual financial audit IF budget >€100k or funder requires (€2-5k)
- [ ] Carbon credit verification IF pursuing carbon revenue (€5-15k investment for revenue)
- [ ] Professional impact assessment IF grant requires (€5-10k, included in grant budget)
- **Decision Trigger**:
  - University partnership signed → Initiate Tier 3 ecological metrics
  - Budget >€100k → Add annual audit
  - Carbon credit revenue potential >€10k/year → Invest in verification

### Deferred Indefinitely:
- ❌ Complex metrics without budget/partnership (don't spend €10k monitoring on €20k budget)
- ❌ Weekly social media if unsustainable (avoid founder burnout)
- ❌ Verification when not required (focus resources on actual restoration work)

## 🎯 Adaptation Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Measure what matters at the level you can afford and sustain.

**Tier 1 is ALWAYS good enough** to prove basic impact:
- "We planted 2,000 trees, 80% survived, here are monthly photos showing forest growing, we spent €25k and have €5k left, 150 volunteers contributed 400 hours."
- → This is credible, transparent, sufficient for small-medium funders and community trust.

**Tier 2 adds credibility** for larger funders:
- "Soil organic carbon increased 15%, water quality tested good, community survey 8/10 satisfaction."
- → This is professional, verified by labs, suitable for larger grants and partnerships.

**Tier 3 proves scientific rigor** for research and major programs:
- "Microbial biomass increased 60% (verified), 45 tons CO₂ sequestered (third-party verified), economic impact study shows €250k local economic activity, peer-reviewed publication accepted."
- → This is research-grade, suitable for carbon credits, major foundations, academic credibility.

**But**: Don't skip Tier 1 trying to jump to Tier 3. Don't spend Tier 3 money when you have Tier 1 budget.

**Adapt monitoring to match your reality** - budget, capacity, partnerships, funder requirements. Start simple, add complexity as resources allow.
