# Site Selection - Project Template

**Part of:** Plan Section (Vision → Plan → Reality)  
**Type:** Template/Playbook for Small Plot Restoration  
**Status:** Template - Customize for Your Project

[Project Hub](/)

## 📋 Overview

Finding the **right land** is foundational to restoration success. This guide provides step-by-step processes for identifying, evaluating, and acquiring suitable sites for holistic environmental restoration.

**This is a template.** When you start your actual project, customize this with your specific geographic region, climate, and local context.

## 🎯 Non-Negotiables (Science Consensus)

These are the constraints based on scientific consensus that cannot be compromised:

1. **Site Assessment Required:** Before acquiring or committing to a site, a comprehensive assessment must be conducted. This includes soil health, water availability, biodiversity baseline, and contamination screening.

2. **Legal Compliance:** All land use must comply with local, regional, and national regulations. Permits and approvals must be obtained before beginning restoration activities.

3. **Native Species Priority:** Site selection should prioritize areas where native species can thrive, or where restoration to native ecosystems is feasible.

4. **Contamination Assessment:** Sites with contamination that cannot be safely managed must be avoided or contamination must be addressed before restoration begins.

5. **Water Availability:** Adequate water (rainfall, groundwater, or managed systems) must be available or feasible to provide for restoration success.

## 🔀 Options & Pathways

### Pathway A: Purchase Land
**When to use:** When you have sufficient funding, want full control, and plan long-term ownership

- Long-term lease (10+ years)
- Conservation easements
- Management agreements
- Partnership with landowner

**Pros:**
- Lower upfront cost
- Can test approach before purchase
- Landowner may provide support
- Flexible arrangements possible

**Cons:**
- Less security than ownership
- May have restrictions
- Ongoing rental costs
- Dependent on landowner relationship

### Pathway C: Partnership or Donation
**When to use:** Landowner wants to support restoration, has conservation goals, or wants tax benefits

**Approach:**
- Land donation
- Partnership agreements
- Conservation easements
- Managed restoration agreements

**Pros:**
- May be low or no cost
- Shared resources and expertise
- Community engagement
- Win-win arrangements

**Cons:**

- Relationship management needed
- Less control than ownership

### Pathway D: Public Land Agreements
**When to use:** Working with government agencies, public lands, or protected areas

**Approach:**
- Management agreements with parks/public lands
- Restoration contracts
- Volunteer partnerships
- Research collaborations

**Pros:**
- Access to larger areas
- Government support possible
- Public benefit clear
- May have existing infrastructure

**Cons:**
- Bureaucratic processes
- May have restrictions
