# Step 5: Research Local Regulations - Project Template

**Part of:** Plan Section (Vision → Plan → Reality)  
**Type:** Template/Playbook for Small Plot Restoration  
**Status:** Template - Customize for Your Project

[← Back to Project Hub](/)

---

## Purpose

Understanding and complying with local regulations is essential for legal operation, avoiding costly delays, and building positive relationships with authorities. Each country, region, and municipality has different requirements for land use, environmental restoration, and NGO operations.

**This is a template.** Customize regulatory research, compliance requirements, and permit processes based on your specific jurisdiction and project type.

## 🎯 Non-Negotiables (Science Consensus)

These must be followed - they are based on legal and practical consensus:

1. **Legal Compliance Required:** All restoration activities must comply with applicable laws and regulations. Non-compliance is illegal and can result in fines, project shutdown, and legal liability.

2. **Permit Requirements:** Required permits must be obtained before beginning work. Working without required permits is illegal.

3. **Documentation:** All regulatory research, permits, and compliance activities must be documented. This is essential for legal protection and future reference.

4. **Ongoing Compliance:** Compliance must be maintained throughout the project. Regulations may change, and ongoing compliance is required.

5. **Expert Consultation:** Complex regulatory issues should be addressed with legal or regulatory experts. Regulatory mistakes can be costly.
