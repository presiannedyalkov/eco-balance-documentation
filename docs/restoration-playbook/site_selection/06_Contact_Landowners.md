[← Back to Project Hub](/)

## Purpose

Establishing contact with landowners is a critical step that requires diplomacy, professionalism, and clear communication. This initial contact sets the tone for potential partnerships or acquisitions.

**This is a template.** Customize contact approaches, communication methods, and negotiation strategies based on your specific project, cultural context, and landowner types.

## 🎯 Non-Negotiables (Science Consensus)

These must be followed - they are based on legal and ethical consensus:

1. **Legal Access:** All contact must be legal and respectful. Trespassing or harassment is not acceptable.

2. **Transparency:** Communication must be transparent and honest. Misleading landowners destroys trust and relationships.

3. **Respect:** Landowners must be treated with respect. Their land, their decisions, their timeline.

4. **Documentation:** All communications and agreements must be documented. This is essential for legal protection.

5. **Professional Approach:** Contact must be professional. Unprofessional approaches damage relationships and project reputation.
