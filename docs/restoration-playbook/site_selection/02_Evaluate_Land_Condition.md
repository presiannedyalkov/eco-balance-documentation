# Step 2: Evaluate Land Condition - Project Template

**Part of:** Plan Section (Vision → Plan → Reality)  
**Type:** Template/Playbook for Small Plot Restoration  
**Status:** Template - Customize for Your Project

[← Back to Project Hub](/)

---

## Purpose

Conduct thorough on-site assessment of land degradation and restoration opportunity.

**This is a template.** Customize assessment methods, evaluation criteria, and documentation approaches based on your specific site, ecosystem type, and restoration goals.

## 🎯 Non-Negotiables (Science Consensus)

These must be followed - they are based on scientific consensus:

1. **On-Site Assessment Required:** Before selecting a site, an on-site assessment must be conducted. Desktop research alone is insufficient.

2. **Soil Assessment Required:** Soil health must be assessed as part of land evaluation. Soil condition is fundamental to restoration success.

3. **Contamination Screening:** If site history suggests potential contamination, appropriate screening must be conducted. Contaminated sites require special handling.

4. **Documentation:** All assessment data must be documented (photos, measurements, observations). This is essential for comparison and decision-making.

5. **Expert Input:** Land evaluation should include input from relevant experts (soil scientist, ecologist, hydrologist) when possible.

## 🔀 Options & Pathways

### Pathway A: Comprehensive Professional Assessment
**When to use:** Larger projects, complex sites, when thoroughness is critical, grant requirements

**Approach:**
- Professional assessment team (ecologist, soil scientist, hydrologist)
- Comprehensive field and lab analysis
- Detailed documentation and mapping
- Professional reports and recommendations

**Pros:**
- Most thorough and accurate
- Professional validation
- Credible for grants
- Comprehensive data

**Cons:**
- Higher cost (€1,000-5,000+)
- Requires professional expertise
- May take longer

### Pathway B: Expert-Guided Assessment
**When to use:** Standard projects, moderate budget, want expert input at lower cost

**Approach:**
- Expert consultation on methodology
- Team conducts assessment with expert guidance
- Expert review of results
- Mix of professional and field methods

**Pros:**
- Lower cost (€300-1,500)
- Professional guidance
- Hands-on learning
- Good balance

**Cons:**
- Less comprehensive
- Requires coordination
- May need expert review

### Pathway C: Community Science Assessment
**When to use:** Limited budget, strong community interest, educational focus, straightforward sites

**Approach:**
- Community members conduct assessment
- Use field guides and simple tools
- Expert review of results
- Educational value

**Pros:**
- Lowest cost (€100-500)
- Community engagement
- Educational value
- Accessible

**Cons:**
- Less accurate
- May miss issues
- Requires training
- May need validation

### Pathway D: Hybrid Approach
**When to use:** Most projects - balance of professional and community methods

**Approach:**
- Professional assessment for critical aspects
- Community involvement in field work
- Expert consultation as needed
- Mix of professional and field methods

**Pros:**
- Good balance
- Cost-effective
- Flexible
- Engages community

**Cons:**
- Requires coordination
- May need ongoing consultation

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Plan Site Visits

- Schedule visits to identified regions
- Arrange expert participation (ecologist, soil scientist)
- Prepare assessment checklists
- Coordinate with local contacts

### Step 2: Soil Assessment

**Field testing:**
- Visual inspection (color, texture, structure)
- Simple infiltration test
- Collect samples for lab analysis
- Document compaction and erosion

**Lab analysis:**
- pH, NPK levels
- Organic matter content
- Microbial activity
- Contamination screening

### Step 3: Vegetation Survey

- Document existing plant species
- Identify invasives vs natives
- Assess coverage and health
- Note remnant habitat patches
- Photo documentation

### Step 4: Water Availability

- Identify natural water sources
- Assess seasonal patterns
- Test water quality if present
- Evaluate groundwater depth
- Check rainfall data

→ Related: [Assess Water Needs](/restoration-playbook/water_management/restoration-playbook-water_management-01_Assess_Water_Needs)

### Step 5: Topography & Microclimate

- Note slopes and aspects
- Identify erosion risk areas
- Document sun exposure patterns
- Wind exposure assessment
- Frost pocket identification

### Step 6: Hazards & Constraints

- Contamination signs
- Unstable slopes
- Flooding risk
- Access limitations
- Adjacent land uses (incompatible activities)

### Step 7: Biodiversity Baseline

- Wildlife signs and observations
- Bird surveys
- Insect diversity
- Remnant species of value
- Connectivity to natural areas

→ Details: [Assess Biodiversity](/restoration-playbook/biodiversity/restoration-playbook-biodiversity-01_Assess_Biodiversity)

### Step 8: Documentation

- Completed assessment forms
- Soil test results
- Photo library (georeferenced)
- Species lists
- Site maps with notes
