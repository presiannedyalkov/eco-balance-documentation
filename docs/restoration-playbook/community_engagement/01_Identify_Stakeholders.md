## Purpose

Stakeholder identification is the foundational step in community engagement. Before you can effectively communicate, involve, or share benefits with your community, you must first understand who that community is.

**This is a template.** Customize stakeholder categories and identification methods based on your specific community, cultural context, and project scope.

## 🎯 Non-Negotiables (Science Consensus)

These must be followed - they are based on scientific and ethical consensus:

1. **Comprehensive Identification Required:** All relevant stakeholders must be identified before beginning engagement. You cannot engage people you don't know exist.

2. **Inclusive Approach:** Stakeholder identification must be inclusive and reach beyond obvious groups. Marginalized and underrepresented voices must be included.

3. **Early Identification:** Stakeholder identification must happen early, before major decisions are made. Late identification leads to opposition and conflict.

4. **Documentation:** All identified stakeholders must be documented with their interests, concerns, and relationship to the project. This is essential for effective engagement.

5. **Ongoing Process:** Stakeholder identification is not one-time - new stakeholders may emerge and should be added as the project evolves.

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Understand Stakeholder Categories

**Stakeholders fall into several overlapping categories:**

**Primary Stakeholders (Directly Affected):**
- People living adjacent to or near restoration site
- Current land users (farmers, ranchers, recreationists)
- Communities dependent on ecosystem services from site
- Indigenous peoples with traditional ties to land
- Those whose livelihoods depend on site resources

**Secondary Stakeholders (Indirectly Affected):**
- Broader community members in watershed or region
- Businesses that might benefit or lose from changes
- Regional residents who use area occasionally
- Future generations (represented by youth, educators)

**Key Influencers:**
- Local political leaders and officials
- Community leaders (formal and informal)
- Media representatives
- Religious or spiritual leaders
- Respected elders or long-time residents
- Environmental advocates and activists

**Institutional Stakeholders:**
- Government agencies (local, regional, national)
- NGOs and conservation organizations
- Academic and research institutions
- Funders and donors
- Private sector companies
- Professional associations

**Internal Stakeholders:**
- Your project team and staff
- Partner organizations
- Board members or advisors
- Volunteers and supporters

**Potential Opponents:**
- Those who benefit from current degraded conditions
- Groups with different land use priorities
- Those who distrust conservation or government
- Competing interests for resources
- People concerned about restrictions or changes

### Step 2: Use Multiple Identification Methods

**Desktop Research:**
- Government records and databases
- Media coverage of area
- Social media and online communities
- Organizational directories
- Public meeting records

**Community Consultation:**
- Ask existing contacts who else should be involved
- Use snowball sampling (ask stakeholders to identify others)
- Community meetings and listening sessions
- Door-to-door outreach
- Public notices and announcements

**Field Observation:**
- Visit the area and observe who uses it
- Attend community events
- Visit local gathering places
- Observe land use patterns

**Expert Consultation:**
- Local government officials
- Community leaders
- NGOs working in area
- Academic researchers
- Long-time residents

### Step 3: Map Stakeholders

**For Each Stakeholder, Document:**
- Name and contact information
- Category (primary, secondary, influencer, etc.)
- Interest in project (supportive, neutral, opposed, unknown)
- Influence level (high, medium, low)
- Relationship to site
- Key concerns or priorities
- Preferred communication methods
- Engagement strategy

**Create Stakeholder Map:**
- Visual representation of stakeholders
- Show relationships between stakeholders
- Indicate influence and interest
- Identify key players and gatekeepers

### Step 4: Prioritize Engagement

**High Priority:**
- High influence + high interest
- Directly affected stakeholders
- Key decision-makers
- Potential strong opponents
- Potential strong allies

**Medium Priority:**
- Moderate influence or interest
- Indirectly affected
- Can be engaged as needed

**Low Priority:**
- Low influence and low interest
- Monitor but minimal engagement

### Step 5: Validate Completeness

**Check for Gaps:**
- Are all directly affected groups included?
- Are marginalized voices represented?
- Are opponents identified?
- Are all key influencers included?
- Are institutional stakeholders covered?

**Seek Feedback:**
- Ask identified stakeholders who else should be included
- Review with community members
- Check with experts
- Update as needed
