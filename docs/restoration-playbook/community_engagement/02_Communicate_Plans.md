# Task 2: Communicate Plans - Project Template

**Part of:** Plan Section (Vision → Plan → Reality)  
**Type:** Template/Playbook for Small Plot Restoration  
**Status:** Template - Customize for Your Project

[← Back to Project Hub](/)

## Purpose

Communication is the bridge between your restoration vision and community understanding, support, and participation. Effective communication transforms strangers into partners, skeptics into supporters, and passive observers into active stewards.

**This is a template.** Customize communication methods, messages, and channels based on your specific community, cultural context, and project scope.

## 🎯 Non-Negotiables (Science Consensus)

These must be followed - they are based on scientific and ethical consensus:

1. **Early Communication Required:** Communication must begin before major decisions are made. Communicating after decisions are made is not genuine engagement.

2. **Two-Way Dialogue:** Communication must be two-way, not just one-way information sharing. Listening is as important as speaking.

3. **Transparency:** Communication must be transparent and honest. Misleading or incomplete information destroys trust.

4. **Accessibility:** Communication must be accessible to all stakeholders (language, format, location, timing). Barriers to participation must be addressed.

5. **Ongoing Process:** Communication must be ongoing, not one-time. Relationships require continuous communication.
