# Task 5: Share Benefits - Project Template

**Part of:** Plan Section (Vision → Plan → Reality)  
**Type:** Template/Playbook for Small Plot Restoration  
**Status:** Template - Customize for Your Project

[← Back to Project Hub](/)

---

## Purpose

Restoration projects generate multiple types of benefits—ecological, economic, social, and cultural. Ensuring that communities experience tangible, equitable benefits is essential for long-term support and success.

**This is a template.** Customize benefit-sharing strategies, mechanisms, and approaches based on your specific project, community needs, and available resources.

## 🎯 Non-Negotiables (Science Consensus)

These must be followed - they are based on ethical and practical consensus:

1. **Benefit Sharing Required:** If the project creates benefits, these must be shared with the community. Projects that only benefit outsiders are not sustainable.

2. **Equitable Distribution:** Benefits must be distributed equitably, especially to those most affected. Unequal distribution creates conflict and undermines support.

3. **Transparency:** Benefit-sharing must be transparent. Hidden benefits or unequal distribution destroys trust.

4. **Documentation:** All benefit-sharing agreements and activities must be documented. This is essential for accountability.

5. **Ongoing Benefits:** Benefits must be ongoing, not one-time. Long-term benefits ensure long-term support.
