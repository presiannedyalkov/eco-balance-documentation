## 📋 Overview

Community engagement is not just a "nice to have" component of ecological restoration—it's essential for long-term success. Projects that involve, educate, and benefit local communities are more likely to be supported, protected, and sustained over time.

**This is a template.** Customize engagement approaches based on your specific community, cultural context, local priorities, and social dynamics.

## 🎯 Non-Negotiables (Science Consensus)

These are the constraints based on scientific consensus that cannot be compromised:

1. **Stakeholder Identification Required:** Before beginning restoration, all relevant stakeholders must be identified. You cannot engage people you don't know exist.

2. **Early Engagement:** Community engagement must begin before major decisions are made. Engaging after decisions are made is not genuine engagement.

3. **Inclusive Participation:** Engagement must be inclusive and accessible. Barriers to participation (language, transportation, time, etc.) must be addressed.

4. **Benefit Sharing:** If the project creates benefits (economic, environmental, social), these must be shared with the community. Projects that only benefit outsiders are not sustainable.

5. **Respect for Local Knowledge:** Traditional and local ecological knowledge must be respected and integrated alongside scientific knowledge. Dismissing local knowledge undermines engagement.
