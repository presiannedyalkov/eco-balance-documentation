# Task 4: Involve Community - Project Template

**Part of:** Plan Section (Vision → Plan → Reality)  
**Type:** Template/Playbook for Small Plot Restoration  
**Status:** Template - Customize for Your Project

[← Back to Project Hub](/)

---

## Purpose

Community involvement transforms restoration from something done "to" or "for" a community into something done "by" and "with" the community. Active participation creates ownership, builds capacity, provides tangible benefits, and ensures long-term stewardship.

**This is a template.** Customize involvement strategies, roles, and programs based on your specific community, cultural context, and project needs.

## 🎯 Non-Negotiables (Science Consensus)

These must be followed - they are based on scientific and ethical consensus:

1. **Meaningful Roles Required:** Community members must have meaningful roles, not token participation. Meaningful involvement creates ownership.

2. **Benefit Sharing:** If the project creates benefits, these must be shared with the community. Projects that only benefit outsiders are not sustainable.

3. **Capacity Building:** Involvement must build local capacity. Building capacity ensures long-term stewardship.

4. **Inclusive Participation:** Participation must be inclusive and accessible. Barriers to participation must be addressed.

5. **Ongoing Involvement:** Involvement must be ongoing, not one-time. Long-term involvement ensures sustainability.
