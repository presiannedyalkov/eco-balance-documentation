# Task 4: Rotate Crops - Project Template

**Part of:** Plan Section (Vision → Plan → Reality)  
**Type:** Template/Playbook for Small Plot Restoration  
**Status:** Template - Customize for Your Project

## Purpose

Crop rotation—the practice of changing what is grown in a specific area over time—is a foundational soil health strategy that prevents nutrient depletion, breaks pest and disease cycles, improves soil structure, and builds organic matter.

**This is a template.** Customize rotation sequences, species selection, and management approaches based on your specific site, climate, and restoration goals.

## 🎯 Non-Negotiables (Science Consensus)

These must be followed - they are based on scientific consensus:

1. **Diversity Required:** Rotation must include diverse plant species. Monocultures deplete nutrients and promote pests and diseases.

2. **Legume Inclusion:** Rotation should include nitrogen-fixing legumes. Legumes add nitrogen to soil through symbiotic bacteria.

3. **Root Diversity:** Rotation should include plants with different root systems. Varied root systems access nutrients at different depths and improve soil structure.

4. **Pest/Disease Break:** Rotation must break pest and disease cycles. Continuous same-species planting promotes problems.

5. **Organic Matter Building:** Rotation should build organic matter. Diverse plantings add different types of organic matter to soil.

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Understand Rotation Principles

**Why rotation works:**
- Different plants have different nutrient needs and contributions
- Varied root systems access nutrients at different depths
- Rotation disrupts pest and disease life cycles
- Diversity supports broader soil microbial communities
- Sequential plantings can progressively improve soil conditions

**Key plant families and their roles:**

**Legumes (nitrogen fixers):**
- Examples: Clover, vetch, alfalfa, peas, beans, lupine
- Contribution: Add nitrogen to soil through symbiotic bacteria
- Root system: Variable, often deep taproots
- Best followed by: Heavy nitrogen feeders

**Grasses (soil builders):**
- Examples: Oats, rye, wheat, barley, native grasses
- Contribution: Dense fibrous roots build structure, add organic matter
- Root system: Extensive, fibrous, shallow to medium
- Best followed by: Any crop, excellent soil conditioner

**Brassicas (nutrient scavengers):**
- Examples: Radish, turnip, mustard, rapeseed
- Contribution: Deep taproots break compaction, scavenge deep nutrients
- Root system: Long taproots penetrating 2-6+ feet
- Best followed by: Shallow-rooted plants benefiting from brought-up nutrients

**Broadleaf forbs (diversity providers):**
- Examples: Buckwheat, sunflower, phacelia, native wildflowers
- Contribution: Diverse biomass, attract beneficial insects, varied nutrients
- Root system: Variable
- Best followed by: Any crop, excellent for biological diversity

### Step 2: Assess Your Restoration Context

**Site conditions:**
- Current vegetation or bare ground?
- Soil test results (nutrients, pH, organic matter)
- Erosion risk level
- Water availability
- Length of growing season
- Target end-state ecosystem

**Timeframe considerations:**
- How many years until permanent vegetation established?
- Can you do multiple rotations per year? (cover crop → cover crop)
- Single long-season planting or multiple short-season crops?
- When does site need to transition to permanent restoration?

**Resources available:**
- Budget for seed and amendments
- Equipment for planting and management
- Labor for establishment and maintenance
- Water for irrigation (if needed)
- Expertise for planning and management

### Step 3: Design Your Rotation Sequence

**Basic 3-year restoration rotation example:**

**Year 1 - Soil Building Phase:**
- Spring: Fast-growing grass/legume mix (oats + field peas)
- Purpose: Quick biomass, initial nitrogen addition, erosion control
- Management: Mow before seed set, leave as mulch
- Fall: Deep-rooted brassica (daikon radish or tillage radish)
- Purpose: Break compaction, scavenge nutrients, winter kill provides mulch

**Year 2 - Nutrient Enhancement Phase:**
- Spring: Legume-heavy mix (crimson clover + hairy vetch)
- Purpose: Maximum nitrogen fixation
- Management: Allow to flower (pollinator support), then crimp or mow
- Fall: Cereal rye or winter wheat
- Purpose: Scavenge excess nitrogen, add organic matter, erosion control

**Year 3 - Transition to Permanent Vegetation:**
- Spring: Light cover crop or native annual forbs
- Purpose: Nurse crop for permanent species
- Summer: Begin establishing permanent native species (trees, shrubs, perennials)
- Management: Cover crop provides erosion control while permanent plants establish

**Adapt to your context:**
- Shorter growing seasons: Fewer rotations per year
- Longer growing seasons: More intensive rotations possible
- Dryland sites: Choose drought-tolerant species, longer growth periods
- Irrigated sites: Can do intensive multi-rotation sequences

### Step 4: Select Species for Each Rotation

**Criteria for species selection:**
- Climate adaptation (hardiness zone, heat tolerance)
- Soil type preference (clay, loam, sand)
- Water requirements (matches site availability)
- Rooting depth (match rotation goals)
- Growth rate (fits timeline)
- Cost and availability
- Seed size (affects seeding rate and cost)
- Termination ease (will it become a weed?)

**Cover crop mixes vs. monocultures:**
- **Mixes (recommended):** 3-7 species provide multiple benefits simultaneously
- **Monocultures:** Simpler management, specific goals (pure nitrogen fixation)
- **Cocktail mixes:** 10+ species for maximum diversity, more complex

**Native vs. non-native:**
- **Non-native cover crops:** Often cheaper, faster growing, well-studied
- **Native species:** Better for final restoration, more expensive, slower establishment
- **Hybrid approach:** Use non-native cover crops for soil building, transition to native permanent vegetation

### Step 5: Implement Rotation Schedule

**Seeding methods:**
- **Broadcast seeding:** Simple, works for many cover crops, may need higher rates
- **Drilled/planted:** Better seed-to-soil contact, more uniform, requires equipment
- **Aerial seeding:** Large areas, less precise, higher rates needed
- **Interseeding:** Plant next crop into living previous crop before termination

**Establishment care:**
- Water if irrigation available and dry conditions
- Monitor germination and emergence
- Scout for pests (usually minimal with covers)
- Protect from grazing/trampling during establishment
- Document growth and performance

**Termination methods:**
- **Mowing:** Simple, creates mulch layer, may need multiple passes
- **Roller-crimping:** Flattens mature plants, excellent mulch, specific timing needed
- **Grazing:** Animals terminate and fertilize, requires management
- **Winter-kill:** Choose frost-sensitive species for natural termination
- **Tarp/mulch:** Smother with heavy layer, organic approach
- **Herbicide:** Last resort, contradicts ecological restoration goals

**Timing of termination:**
- Before seed set (prevent volunteer problems)
- At flowering (maximum biomass for legumes)
- After full maturity (maximum biomass for grasses)
- Before next planting window

### Step 6: Monitor and Adjust

**Track performance:**
- Germination success rates
- Plant health and vigor
- Biomass production
- Soil improvements (retest annually)
- Pest and disease issues
- Weed suppression effectiveness

**Adaptive management:**
- Adjust species based on performance
- Modify timing based on weather
- Change termination methods if needed
- Learn and improve each cycle
