# Task 5: Manage Pests and Diseases - Project Template

**Part of:** Plan Section (Vision → Plan → Reality)  
**Type:** Template/Playbook for Small Plot Restoration  
**Status:** Template - Customize for Your Project

[← Back to Project Hub](/)

## Purpose

Healthy soil is the foundation of pest and disease resistance. Rather than treating symptoms with external inputs, effective soil-based pest and disease management focuses on building robust soil ecosystems that naturally suppress problems while supporting beneficial organisms.

**This is a template.** Customize pest management strategies, monitoring methods, and control approaches based on your specific site, species, and pest/disease challenges.

## 🎯 Non-Negotiables (Science Consensus)

These must be followed - they are based on scientific consensus:

1. **Soil Health Foundation:** Healthy soil is the foundation of pest and disease resistance. Unhealthy soil promotes problems.

2. **Prevention First:** Pest and disease management must focus on prevention. Prevention is more effective than treatment.

3. **Integrated Approach:** Pest management must use integrated approaches. Single-method approaches are less effective.

4. **Biological Controls Preferred:** Biological controls should be preferred over chemical controls. Chemical controls harm soil biology.

5. **Monitoring Required:** Pests and diseases must be monitored. Early detection allows effective response.

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Understand Soil Health as Disease Prevention

**The soil-plant-pest connection:**
- Healthy soil = healthy plants = natural pest resistance
- Diverse soil biology outcompetes pathogens
- Balanced nutrients prevent plant stress that attracts pests
- Good soil structure supports strong root systems
- Active soil food web creates hostile environment for many pests

**Soil health foundations:**
- Adequate organic matter (3-10% depending on ecosystem)
- Balanced nutrients (not excess or deficiency)
- Neutral to slightly acidic pH (6.0-7.5 for most species)
- Good structure and drainage
- Diverse microbial communities
- Active mycorrhizal fungal networks

### Step 2: Identify Common Soil-Related Pests and Diseases

**Soil-dwelling pests:**
- Root-feeding nematodes
- Grubs
- Cutworms
- Wireworms
- Root maggots
- Slugs and snails

**Soil-borne diseases:**
- Damping off
- Root rots
- Verticillium and fusarium wilts
- Club root
- White mold
- Bacterial wilts

**Signs and symptoms:**
- Stunted growth
- Yellowing
- Wilting despite water
- Root damage
- Seedling death
- Reduced vigor

### Step 3: Implement Preventive Practices

**Cultural practices:**
- Crop rotation → [Rotate Crops](../../04_Rotate_Crops)
- Sanitation (remove infected material)
- Proper timing (plant when conditions favor plants, not pests)
- Appropriate spacing (good air circulation)
- Water management (avoid overwatering)
- Clean tools and equipment

**Soil amendments for disease suppression:**
- Compost (suppressive composts)
- Compost tea
- Vermicompost
- Biochar
- Mycorrhizal inoculants

**Resistant species:**
- Research disease resistance
- Use native plants (often more resistant)
- Genetic diversity (don't plant all same variety)

**Physical barriers:**
- Mulch (reduces splash, creates barrier)
- Row covers
- Copper tape (for slugs)
- Collars for seedlings

### Step 4: Monitor Regularly

**Monitoring schedule:**
- Weekly scouting walks
- Check for signs and symptoms
- Document with photos and notes
- Track patterns and spread
- Identify accurately before acting

**What to monitor:**
- Plant health and vigor
- Pest presence and damage
- Disease symptoms
- Beneficial organism presence
- Environmental conditions

### Step 5: Use Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

**Decision hierarchy:**
1. **Tolerance:** Accept minor damage (not all pests need control)
2. **Cultural controls:** First choice (prevention, rotation, etc.)
3. **Biological controls:** Second choice (beneficial organisms)
4. **Physical/mechanical controls:** Third choice (hand-picking, barriers)
5. **Low-impact pesticides:** Last resort (only when necessary)

**IPM Principles:**
- Prevention first
- Monitor and identify
- Use multiple strategies
- Target specific problems
- Minimize harm to beneficials
- Evaluate effectiveness

### Step 6: Implement Biological Controls

**Beneficial organisms:**
- Beneficial nematodes for soil pests
- Predatory insects and mites
- Microbial pesticides (Bt, beneficial fungi)
- Compost tea applications
- Create habitat for beneficials

**Supporting beneficials:**
- Provide diverse habitat
- Avoid broad-spectrum pesticides
- Plant diverse species
- Maintain healthy soil
- Provide water sources

### Step 7: Address Specific Problems

**Nematodes:**
- Marigolds (suppressive)
- Brassica cover crops
- Compost applications
- Beneficial nematodes

**Grubs:**
- Beneficial nematodes
- Milky spore (for Japanese beetle grubs)
- Healthy soil (supports natural controls)

**Fungal diseases:**
- Improve drainage
- Compost tea
- Biological fungicides
- Remove infected material

**Slugs:**
- Hand-picking
- Iron phosphate (organic)
- Copper barriers
- Diatomaceous earth

**Bacterial diseases:**
- Remove infected plants
- Improve air circulation
- Avoid overhead watering
- Sanitize tools

## 💡 Customization Notes

**When using this template for your project:**

1. **Pest/Disease Context:** Adapt strategies to your specific pest and disease challenges

2. **Species:** Some species are more resistant than others - choose wisely

3. **Site Conditions:** Adjust management based on your site (soil, climate, etc.)

4. **Budget:** Choose management pathway based on available resources

5. **Timeline:** Plan for ongoing management - pests and diseases are ongoing challenges

6. **Local Knowledge:** Engage local experts who know common pests and diseases in your area

**Remember:** This is a template. Your actual project will have specific pest/disease challenges, site conditions, and resource constraints that make it unique.
