# Task 1: Assess Soil Health - Project Template

**Part of:** Plan Section (Vision → Plan → Reality)  
**Type:** Template/Playbook for Small Plot Restoration  
**Status:** Template - Customize for Your Project

[← Back to Project Hub](/)

## Purpose

Assessing soil health is the critical first step in any soil restoration effort. Without understanding your baseline conditions, you cannot develop an effective restoration strategy or measure your progress.

**This is a template.** Customize testing methods, sampling strategies, and analysis approaches based on your specific site, budget, and restoration goals.

## 🎯 Non-Negotiables (Science Consensus)

These must be followed - they are based on scientific consensus:

1. **Baseline Assessment Required:** Before applying any amendments or treatments, a baseline soil assessment must be conducted. You cannot improve what you don't measure.

2. **Proper Sampling:** Soil samples must be collected using proper methods (composite sampling, appropriate depth, contamination prevention). Improper sampling leads to inaccurate results.

3. **Essential Tests:** At minimum, pH, organic matter, and major nutrients (N, P, K) must be tested. These are fundamental to understanding soil health.

4. **Documentation:** All sampling locations, methods, and results must be documented. This is essential for tracking changes over time and adaptive management.

5. **Contamination Screening:** If site history suggests potential contamination, appropriate screening must be conducted before restoration begins.

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Plan Your Sampling Strategy

**Create a sampling grid:**
- Divide large sites into zones based on topography, vegetation, or land use history
- Plan for at least one composite sample per 2-5 acres for uniform areas
- Increase sampling density in areas with obvious variations
- Note GPS coordinates for each sampling location for future reference

**Timing considerations:**
- Avoid sampling immediately after fertilizer application or heavy rain
- Best timing is typically spring or fall when soil is workable
- Maintain consistent timing for annual follow-up tests

### Step 2: Collect Soil Samples

**Equipment needed:**
- Soil probe or auger (stainless steel preferred)
- Clean plastic buckets (one per composite sample)
- Sealable plastic bags or sample containers
- Labels and permanent markers
- GPS device or smartphone with GPS
- Field notebook for observations
- Camera for documentation

**Collection process:**
- Remove surface debris (leaves, grass) from sampling point
- Take samples from consistent depth (typically 0-6 inches for most purposes)
- For each composite sample, collect 10-15 subsamples in a zigzag pattern
- Mix subsamples thoroughly in clean bucket
- Transfer approximately 1-2 cups to labeled container
- Record location, depth, date, and any visual observations

**Visual assessment while sampling:**
- Note soil color (indicates organic matter and drainage)
- Observe soil texture (sand, silt, clay proportions)
- Check for compaction layers
- Look for earthworms and other soil organisms
- Note any unusual odors (may indicate contamination or anaerobic conditions)
- Document root presence and condition

### Step 3: Conduct Laboratory Analysis

**Essential tests:**
- **Macro-nutrients:** Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K)
- **Secondary nutrients:** Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg), Sulfur (S)
- **Micronutrients:** Iron, Zinc, Manganese, Copper, Boron (if indicated)
- **Soil pH:** Critical for nutrient availability
- **Organic matter content:** Indicator of soil health
- **Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC):** Soil's ability to hold nutrients

**Optional advanced tests:**
- Heavy metal screening (if contamination suspected)
- Soil respiration (biological activity indicator)
- Mycorrhizal fungi colonization rates
- Soil microbial biomass
- Aggregate stability
- Infiltration rate
- Electrical conductivity (salinity)

**Laboratory selection:**
- Use certified soil testing laboratories
- University extension services often provide affordable testing
- Specify "restoration" or "ecological" testing package if available
- Request interpretation guides with results

### Step 4: Perform Field Assessments

**Soil structure test:**
- Dig a 12-inch deep hole
- Examine soil profile for distinct layers
- Check for compaction (hardpan layers)
- Observe root penetration
- Note drainage characteristics

**Infiltration test:**
- Measure how quickly water soaks into soil
- Indicates compaction and structure
- Simple field test with water and timing

**Earthworm count:**
- Count earthworms per cubic foot
- Indicator of biological activity
- Healthy soil typically has 10+ earthworms per cubic foot

### Step 5: Interpret Results and Create Plan

**Analyze test results:**
- Compare to regional benchmarks
- Identify deficiencies and excesses
- Determine pH adjustments needed
- Calculate amendment requirements

**Create soil restoration plan:**
- Prioritize issues (most critical first)
- Determine amendment types and quantities
- Plan application schedule
- Set monitoring schedule

**Document baseline:**
- Keep all test results
- Create soil maps
- Document conditions
- Establish monitoring points

## 💡 Customization Notes

**When using this template for your project:**

1. **Site Size:** Adjust sampling density based on site size and variability

2. **Budget:** Choose testing pathway based on available resources

3. **Soil Type:** Adapt methods to your specific soil type (clay, sand, loam, etc.)

4. **History:** Consider site history when planning tests (contamination, previous use)

5. **Goals:** Focus tests on what matters for your restoration goals

6. **Local Resources:** Use local extension services, labs, and experts

**Remember:** This is a template. Your actual project will have specific soil conditions, budget constraints, and goals that make it unique.
