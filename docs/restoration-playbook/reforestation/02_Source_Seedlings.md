# Task 2: Source Seedlings - Project Template

**Part of:** Plan Section (Vision → Plan → Reality)  
**Type:** Template/Playbook for Small Plot Restoration  
**Status:** Template - Customize for Your Project

[← Back to Project Hub](/)

---

## Purpose

Once you've identified the right species, you need to find high-quality, healthy seedlings from reputable sources. Quality seedlings are essential for high survival rates and successful ecosystem restoration.

**This is a template.** Customize supplier selection, sourcing strategies, and quality standards based on your specific region, species needs, and budget.

## 🎯 Non-Negotiables (Science Consensus)

These must be followed - they are based on scientific consensus:

1. **Native Species Only:** Only native species seedlings should be sourced. Non-native species can disrupt ecosystem function.

2. **Local Provenance Preferred:** When possible, use locally-sourced seeds/seedlings from the same region. Local genetic material is best adapted to local conditions.

3. **Disease-Free Stock:** Seedlings must be disease-free and healthy. Introducing diseased stock can harm the entire restoration project.

4. **Proper Documentation:** All seedlings must be documented with species, provenance, source, and date. This is essential for tracking and adaptive management.

5. **Quality Standards:** Seedlings must meet minimum quality standards (healthy roots, appropriate size, no damage). Poor quality seedlings have high mortality.

- Higher cost but guaranteed quality

**Pros:**
- Highest quality
- Expert support
- Reliable supply
- Professional standards

**Cons:**
- Higher cost (€5-15 per seedling)
- May have minimum orders

### Pathway B: Conservation Organizations
**When to use:** Restoration projects, limited budget, want subsidized pricing, value partnerships

**Approach:**
- Work with conservation organizations
- Subsidized pricing for restoration

- May have limited species
- Partnership benefits

**Pros:**
- Lower cost (€2-5 per seedling)
- Restoration focus
- Technical support
- Partnership benefits

**Cons:**
- Limited species selection
- May have requirements
- Longer lead times
- Less flexible

### Pathway C: Community Seed Banks & Propagation
**When to use:** Community engagement focus, want local genetic material, educational goals, long timeline

**Approach:**
- Collect local seeds
- Community propagation
- Local nurseries or volunteers
- Best local adaptation
- Educational value

**Pros:**
- Best local genetics
- Lowest cost (€0-2 per seedling)
- Community engagement
- Educational value

**Cons:**
- Requires lead time (1-2+ years)
- Requires expertise
- More coordination
- Variable quality

### Pathway D: Hybrid Approach
**When to use:** Most projects - balance of quality, cost, and local adaptation

**Approach:**
- Professional nurseries for key species
- Conservation organizations for others
- Local propagation for special cases
- Mix based on availability and needs

**Pros:**
- Good balance
- Flexible
- Cost-effective
- Local adaptation where possible

**Cons:**
- Requires coordination
- Multiple suppliers
- May need planning

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Identify Potential Suppliers

**Supplier Types:**

**Native Plant Nurseries:**
- Specialize in native species
- Often have expertise in local ecology
- May offer smaller quantities
- Usually more expensive but higher quality

**Conservation Organizations:**
- May have seedling programs
- Often subsidized pricing for restoration projects
- Can provide technical support
- May have limited species selection

**Government Forestry Programs:**
- Sometimes offer free/subsidized seedlings
- May have requirements (land size, management plans)
- Limited to certain species
- Can have long lead times

**Commercial Suppliers:**
- Large quantities available
- Competitive pricing
- May not specialize in natives
- Quality can vary

**Community Seed Banks:**
- Local seed collection and propagation
- Best local genetic adaptation
- May need lead time for growing
- Supports community engagement

### Step 2: Evaluate Supplier Quality

**Key Questions to Ask:**

**About the Seedlings:**
- Are they grown from locally-sourced seeds?
- What is the genetic provenance (origin)?
- What age/size are the seedlings?
- What is the typical survival rate?
- Are they disease-free and certified?
- What container type (bare root, pot, plug)?

**About Growing Conditions:**
- Were they grown in conditions similar to planting site?
- What fertilizers/treatments were used?
- Are they hardened off for field conditions?

**Logistics:**
- What is the lead time for orders?
- What quantities are available?
- What is the delivery schedule?
- What are the costs (per seedling, delivery, etc.)?
- What guarantees or warranties are offered?

### Step 3: Determine Quantities

**Calculate Needs Based On:**

**Planting Area:**
- Total hectares to be planted
- Desired tree density (trees per hectare)
- Species mix proportions

**Expected Survival Rate:**
- Order 20-30% more than needed
- Account for mortality during establishment
- Have backup seedlings for replacement

**Example Calculation:**
```
Area: 1 hectare
Density: 1,000 trees/hectare (dense restoration planting)
Base need: 1,000 seedlings
Buffer (25%): 250 seedlings
Total order: 1,250 seedlings
```

**Species Breakdown:**
Apply your species mix percentages to determine quantities for each species.

### Step 4: Request Quotes

**Information to Provide:**
- Species and quantities needed
- Preferred seedling size/age
- Delivery location and timing
- Your organization status (NGO for potential discounts)
- Project overview (restoration vs. commercial)

**Compare:**
- Price per seedling
- Delivery costs
- Payment terms
- Lead time
- Quality certifications
- Support/advice offered

### Step 5: Time Your Order

**Critical Timing Considerations:**

**Planting Season:**
- Match delivery to optimal planting time
- Avoid summer planting (high mortality)
- Plan for appropriate season in your region

**Lead Time:**
- Native nurseries: 3-6 months minimum
- Custom propagation: 6-12+ months
- Popular species: may require 1+ year advance order

**Delivery Window:**
- Schedule delivery 1-2 weeks before planting
- Seedlings should be planted ASAP after delivery
- Don't order too early (storage challenges)
- Weather backup plan if planting delayed

### Step 6: Arrange Storage

**If Temporary Storage Needed:**

**Short-term (1-2 weeks):**
- Keep in original containers
- Store in shade
- Water regularly (don't let dry out)
- Protect from wind and extreme temperatures
- Maintain 100% humidity if possible

**Longer-term Storage (avoid if possible):**
- Heeling in (planting temporarily in soil)
- Cold storage facility (for bare root)
- Professional nursery boarding

### Step 7: Inspect Upon Delivery

**Quality Checks:**

**Visual Inspection:**
- ✅ Healthy green foliage
- ✅ Strong, undamaged stems
- ✅ Well-developed root system
- ✅ No signs of disease or pests
- ✅ Appropriate size for species/age

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ Wilted or yellow leaves
- ❌ Broken or damaged stems
- ❌ Root-bound or circling roots
- ❌ Mold or fungal growth
- ❌ Insect infestation

**Documentation:**
- Count seedlings received
- Photograph overall delivery
- Document any quality issues
- Report problems immediately to supplier
