# Task 1: Identify Native Species - Project Template

**Part of:** Plan Section (Vision → Plan → Reality)  
**Type:** Template/Playbook for Small Plot Restoration  
**Status:** Template - Customize for Your Project

[← Back to Project Hub](/)

---

## Purpose

Identifying the right native species is the **foundation of successful reforestation**. Native species are adapted to local conditions and play essential roles in the ecosystem, supporting local wildlife and maintaining ecological balance.

**This is a template.** Customize species lists based on your specific region, climate, and ecosystem type.

## 🎯 Non-Negotiables (Science Consensus)

These must be followed - they are based on scientific consensus:

1. **Native Species Only:** Only native tree and shrub species should be selected. Non-native species can disrupt ecosystem function and outcompete natives.

2. **Site-Appropriate Selection:** Species must be selected based on actual site conditions (soil, climate, water availability). Planting inappropriate species will fail.

3. **Diversity Required:** Multiple species must be selected, not monocultures. Diverse species mixes are ecologically stable and resilient.

4. **Local Provenance:** When possible, use locally-sourced seeds/seedlings from the same region. Local genetic material is best adapted to local conditions.

5. **Documentation:** All species selections must be documented with scientific names and rationale. This is essential for tracking and adaptive management.

## 🔀 Options & Pathways

### Pathway A: Professional Ecological Assessment
**When to use:** Larger projects, when scientific credibility is needed, grant-funded projects, research partnerships

**Approach:**
- Hire professional ecologist or botanist
- Comprehensive species list based on site assessment
- Reference site comparisons
- Historical vegetation research
- Scientific validation

**Pros:**
- Most scientifically sound
- Credible for grants
- Comprehensive species list
- Professional validation

**Cons:**
- Higher cost (€500-2,000)
- Requires professional expertise
- May take longer

### Pathway B: Community Science & Local Knowledge
**When to use:** Smaller projects, limited budget, strong local naturalist community, educational focus

**Approach:**
- Consult local naturalist groups (NABU, etc.)
- Use citizen science platforms (iNaturalist, etc.)
- Engage local botanists and ecologists as volunteers
- Research regional native plant lists
- Integrate traditional/local knowledge

**Pros:**
- Lower cost (€0-500)
- Builds community engagement
- Integrates local knowledge
- Educational value

**Cons:**
- May miss some species
- Less comprehensive
- Requires coordination
- May need expert validation

### Pathway C: Hybrid Approach
**When to use:** Most projects - balance of professional guidance and local knowledge

**Approach:**
- Professional assessment for key species
- Local knowledge for additional species
- Expert review of final list
- Community input on priorities

**Pros:**
- Good balance of quality and cost
- Integrates multiple knowledge sources
- Flexible and adaptable
- Engages community

**Cons:**
- Requires coordination
- May need ongoing consultation

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Research Native Flora

**Information Sources:**
- Local conservation organizations
- University botany departments
- Regional botanical gardens
- Government forestry agencies
- Historical vegetation surveys

**Key Resources:**
- Plant databases (e.g., Native Plant Societies)
- Regional flora guides
- Academic publications on local ecology
- Traditional ecological knowledge from elders

### Step 2: Assess Site Conditions

**Climate Factors:**
- Average annual rainfall
- Temperature ranges (extremes and averages)
- Frost patterns and growing season
- Wind exposure
- Microclimate variations

**Soil Characteristics:**
- Soil type and texture
- pH levels
- Drainage patterns
- Organic matter content
- Existing vegetation indicators

→ Reference: [Assess Soil Health](../soil_restoration/01_Assess_Soil_Health)

### Step 3: Evaluate Species Suitability

**For Each Potential Species, Consider:**

**Growth Characteristics:**
- Growth rate (fast vs. slow)
- Mature size (height and spread)
- Root system type (deep taproot vs. shallow)
- Lifespan and longevity

**Climate Adaptation:**
- Drought tolerance
- Heat tolerance
- Cold hardiness
- Wind resistance
- Fire resistance (where relevant)

**Ecological Role:**
- Food source for wildlife (fruit, nuts, flowers)
- Habitat value (nesting, shelter)
- Soil improvement (nitrogen-fixing, deep roots)
- Water management (transpiration, infiltration)

**Site Match:**
- Soil type preferences
- Water requirements
- Light requirements (sun, shade, partial)
- Successional stage (pioneer vs. climax)

### Step 4: Create Species List

**Document for Each Species:**
- Scientific name (required)
- Common name(s)
- Site suitability rating
- Ecological role
- Availability (can you source it?)
- Cost estimate
- Planting priority

**Ensure Diversity:**
- Multiple canopy layers (trees, shrubs, understory)
- Different successional stages
- Various ecological functions
- Mix of fast and slow growers
- Different sizes and forms

### Step 5: Validate and Refine

**Expert Review:**
- Have ecologist or botanist review list
- Check against regional native plant lists
- Verify site appropriateness
- Adjust based on feedback

**Final Selection:**
- Prioritize based on site conditions
- Ensure diversity
- Consider availability and cost
- Plan for phased planting if needed

## 💡 Customization Notes

**When using this template for your project:**

1. **Regional Species:** Replace generic examples with species native to your specific region

2. **Climate Adaptation:** Select species adapted to your climate (consider climate change projections)

3. **Site Conditions:** Match species to your actual soil, water, and light conditions

4. **Ecosystem Type:** Choose species appropriate for your target ecosystem (forest, woodland, savanna, etc.)

5. **Availability:** Consider what species you can actually source - availability may limit choices

6. **Local Knowledge:** Engage local experts and community members who know the area

**Remember:** This is a template. Your actual project will have specific species native to your region that make it unique.
