# Task 4: Efficient Irrigation - Project Template

**Part of:** Plan Section (Vision → Plan → Reality)  
**Type:** Template/Playbook for Small Plot Restoration  
**Status:** Template - Customize for Your Project

[← Back to Project Hub](/)

---

## Purpose

While the goal of restoration is to create self-sustaining ecosystems that ultimately require minimal irrigation, supplemental water is often necessary during establishment and in water-limited environments. Efficient irrigation ensures every drop counts.

**This is a template.** Customize irrigation methods, systems, and management approaches based on your specific water needs, site conditions, and budget.

## 🎯 Non-Negotiables (Science Consensus)

These must be followed - they are based on scientific consensus:

1. **Water Efficiency Required:** Irrigation must be efficient. Wasting water is not acceptable, especially in water-limited environments.

2. **Appropriate Timing:** Irrigation must occur at appropriate times. Wrong timing wastes water and can harm plants.

3. **Root Zone Targeting:** Water must be delivered to root zones. Watering non-root areas wastes water.

4. **Monitoring Required:** Irrigation must be monitored. You cannot optimize what you don't measure.

5. **Reduction Over Time:** Irrigation should be reduced as plants mature. Goal is self-sustaining ecosystems.

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Assess Irrigation Needs

**Review water assessment:**
- Refer to [Assess Water Needs](../../01_Assess_Water_Needs)
- Identify areas requiring supplemental water
- Determine irrigation duration (establishment only vs. ongoing)
- Calculate peak demand periods

**Zone the site:**
- **High priority:** Rare species, expensive plantings, demonstration areas
- **Medium priority:** Standard restoration plantings
- **Low priority:** Drought-adapted species, mature plants
- **No irrigation:** Native species after establishment

**Establish irrigation goals:**
- Short-term: Support establishment (years 1-3)
- Medium-term: Drought assistance only (years 3-5)
- Long-term: Minimal or no irrigation (year 5+)

### Step 2: Choose Appropriate Irrigation Method

**Drip irrigation (most efficient - recommended):**
- **Efficiency:** 85-95%
- **Method:** Delivers water slowly directly to root zone
- **Best for:** Individual plants, rows, gardens, most restoration
- **Advantages:** Minimal evaporation, no runoff, targets roots, reduces weeds
- **Disadvantages:** Requires filtration, can clog, initial cost, maintenance
- **Components:** Mainline, laterals, emitters, filters, pressure regulator

**Micro-sprayers:**
- **Efficiency:** 75-85%
- **Method:** Small spray patterns around plants
- **Best for:** Shrubs, grouped plantings, areas needing coverage
- **Advantages:** Waters multiple plants, adjustable patterns
- **Disadvantages:** More evaporation than drip, wind affects pattern

**Soaker hoses:**
- **Efficiency:** 70-80%
- **Method:** Porous hose weeps water along length
- **Best for:** Rows, hedges, simple layouts
- **Advantages:** Inexpensive, easy to install, flexible
- **Disadvantages:** Uneven distribution, shorter lifespan, hard to monitor

**Overhead sprinklers:**
- **Efficiency:** 50-70%
- **Method:** Throws water through air
- **Best for:** Turf, broadcast seeding, emergency only
- **Disadvantages:** High evaporation, promotes disease, weed germination, water waste
- **When acceptable:** Initial germination of seed mixes

**Hand watering:**
- **Efficiency:** Variable (often 30-50%)
- **Method:** Hose or watering can
- **Best for:** Small areas, individual care, supplementing other systems
- **Advantages:** Flexible, immediate response to plant needs
- **Disadvantages:** Labor intensive, inconsistent, often wastes water

**Recommendation hierarchy:**
1. Drip irrigation for most plantings
2. Micro-sprayers for shrub groupings
3. Soaker hoses for simple rows (budget option)
4. Hand watering for small scale only
5. Overhead sprinklers avoid if possible

### Step 3: Design the Irrigation System

**System layout planning:**

**1. Draw site map:**
- Mark all plants or planting areas
- Note elevations and slopes
- Identify water source location
- Plan mainline routes
- Design zone layouts

**2. Calculate water requirements:**
- Plant water needs (species-specific)
- Peak demand periods
- System capacity needed
- Flow rate requirements

**3. Zone design:**
- Group plants with similar water needs
- Separate high and low water users
- Consider sun exposure
- Plan for expansion

**4. Component selection:**
- Mainline size and material
- Lateral sizes
- Emitter types and flow rates
- Filter requirements
- Pressure regulation needs

### Step 4: Install System

**Installation sequence:**
1. Install mainline from water source
2. Install filters and pressure regulators
3. Install zone valves (if automated)
4. Install laterals to each zone
5. Install emitters at each plant
6. Test system thoroughly
7. Adjust and fine-tune

**Installation best practices:**
- Follow manufacturer specifications
- Ensure proper slope for drainage
- Protect from damage
- Label zones clearly
- Document layout

### Step 5: Manage Irrigation

**Watering schedule:**
- **Establishment (Year 1):** Frequent, deep watering
- **Year 2-3:** Gradual reduction
- **Year 4+:** Drought assistance only
- Adjust based on weather and plant needs

**Monitoring:**
- Check system regularly
- Monitor plant health
- Measure water use
- Adjust schedule as needed
- Document performance

**Maintenance:**
- Clean filters regularly
- Check for leaks
- Flush system periodically
- Replace worn components
- Winterize if needed

### Step 6: Reduce Over Time

**Gradual reduction:**
- Year 1: Full establishment support
- Year 2: Reduce frequency
- Year 3: Reduce further
- Year 4+: Minimal or no irrigation

**Goal:**
- Self-sustaining ecosystems
- Minimal external water inputs
- Native species adapted to site
- Natural water cycles
