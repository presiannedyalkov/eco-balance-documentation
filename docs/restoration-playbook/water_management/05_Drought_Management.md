# Task 5: Drought Management - Project Template

**Part of:** Plan Section (Vision → Plan → Reality)  
**Type:** Template/Playbook for Small Plot Restoration  
**Status:** Template - Customize for Your Project

[← Back to Project Hub](/)

---

## Purpose

Drought is an inevitable challenge in restoration, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions and with increasing climate variability. Effective drought management combines proactive strategies to reduce vulnerability, tactical responses during dry periods, and recovery planning for post-drought resilience.

**This is a template.** Customize drought strategies, species selection, and management approaches based on your specific climate, site conditions, and water availability.

## 🎯 Non-Negotiables (Science Consensus)

These must be followed - they are based on scientific consensus:

1. **Drought Planning Required:** Restoration projects must plan for drought. Drought is inevitable in most regions.

2. **Species Selection:** Species must be selected for drought tolerance. Water-demanding species in drought-prone areas will fail.

3. **Water Storage:** Adequate water storage is essential for drought resilience. Without storage, drought response is limited.

4. **Monitoring Required:** Drought conditions must be monitored. Early detection allows proactive response.

5. **Adaptive Management:** Drought management must be adaptive. Adjust strategies based on experience and changing conditions.

**Approach:**
- Strategic infrastructure where needed
- Drought-adapted species
- Natural methods where possible
- Adaptive management
- Flexible approach

**Pros:**
- Good balance
- Flexible
- Cost-effective
- Adaptable

**Cons:**

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Understand Drought Risk

**Assess local drought patterns:**
- Historical drought frequency (decades or centuries)
- Typical drought duration (months or years)
- Severity ranges (moderate to extreme)
- Seasonal patterns (summer drought vs. year-round)
- Recent trends and climate projections

**Classify your drought context:**
- **Annual summer drought:** Mediterranean climates, predictable
- **Periodic multi-year drought:** Cycles every 5-15 years
- **Unpredictable drought:** Variable timing and intensity
- **Chronic water limitation:** Arid lands, permanent water stress

**Determine vulnerability:**
- Site water-holding capacity
- Plant water requirements
- Existing water storage
- Irrigation capacity and reliability
- Recovery potential after drought

### Step 2: Design for Drought Resilience (Proactive)

**Site-level strategies:**

**Maximize water capture and retention:**
- Implement all [rainwater harvesting](/restoration-playbook/water_management/restoration-playbook-water_management-02_Rainwater_Harvesting) strategies
- Build adequate [water storage](/restoration-playbook/water_management/restoration-playbook-water_management-03_Build_Water_Storage_Structures)
- Create swales and berms to slow and sink water
- Increase soil organic matter (each 1% holds significant water)
- Mulch all bare soil to reduce evaporation
- Contour planting on slopes to capture runoff

**Reduce water demand:**
- Select drought-adapted native species as priority
- Group plants by water needs (hydrozoning)
- Reduce total planted area if water-limited
- Space plants wider initially
- Avoid water-demanding species unless essential
- Plan for natural attrition during establishment

**Create microclimates:**
- North-facing slopes retain more moisture
- Sheltered areas protected from drying winds
- Shade structures reduce evapotranspiration
- Nurse plants provide microclimate for others
- Rock mulches create cooler root zones

**Improve soil water efficiency:**
- Deep, well-structured soil holds more water
- Follow all [soil restoration](/restoration-playbook/soil_restoration/restoration-playbook-soil_restoration-00_Soil_Restoration_Overview) practices
- Mycorrhizal fungi extend water access
- Reduce compaction for better infiltration
- Clay soils hold water better than sand

### Step 3: Select Drought-Tolerant Species

**Characteristics of drought-tolerant plants:**
- Deep root systems
- Small or waxy leaves
- Native to your region
- Evolved for local rainfall patterns
- Able to go dormant during stress
- Rapid recovery after rain

**Species selection strategy:**
- **Backbone (60-80%):** Highly drought-tolerant natives
- **Supporting (15-30%):** Moderately drought-tolerant
- **Accent (5-10%):** May need occasional water during extreme drought

### Step 4: Implement Water Conservation

**Irrigation efficiency:**
- Use efficient irrigation methods → [Efficient Irrigation](/restoration-playbook/water_management/restoration-playbook-water_management-04_Efficient_Irrigation)
- Drip irrigation for targeted delivery
- Water only when necessary
- Monitor soil moisture
- Adjust based on conditions

**Mulching:**
- Apply organic mulch to all planted areas
- Maintain 5-10cm depth
- Refresh annually
- Reduces evaporation significantly

**Watering strategies:**
- Deep, infrequent watering (encourages deep roots)
- Water early morning or evening
- Avoid overhead watering (reduces evaporation)
- Focus on establishment period only

### Step 5: Monitor and Respond

**Drought Monitoring:**
- Track precipitation
- Monitor soil moisture
- Observe plant stress indicators
- Track water storage levels
- Document conditions

**Response Strategies:**

**Early Drought:**
- Increase mulching
- Reduce irrigation frequency but maintain depth
- Prioritize high-value plantings
- Monitor closely

**Moderate Drought:**
- Focus irrigation on critical areas only
- Accept some mortality in low-priority areas
- Reduce irrigation to survival levels
- Protect most valuable plantings

**Severe Drought:**
- Emergency irrigation only
- Focus on survival, not growth
- Accept significant mortality
- Protect seed sources and rare species
- Plan for post-drought recovery

### Step 6: Post-Drought Recovery

**Assessment:**
- Assess damage and survival
- Identify what survived and why
- Learn from experience
- Document lessons

**Recovery Actions:**
- Replace dead plants when conditions improve
- Support recovery of stressed plants
- Improve water systems based on lessons
- Adjust species selection
- Enhance drought resilience

**Adaptation:**
- Learn from drought experience
- Adjust strategies based on results
- Improve systems for future droughts
- Share knowledge with others
