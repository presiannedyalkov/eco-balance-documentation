# Task 3: Build Water Storage Structures - Project Template

**Part of:** Plan Section (Vision → Plan → Reality)  
**Type:** Template/Playbook for Small Plot Restoration  
**Status:** Template - Customize for Your Project

[← Back to Project Hub](/)

---

## Purpose

Water storage structures bridge the gap between when rain falls and when water is needed. By capturing and holding water during surplus periods, you ensure availability during dry seasons and droughts.

**This is a template.** Customize storage types, sizes, and designs based on your specific water needs, site conditions, and budget.

## 🎯 Non-Negotiables (Science Consensus)

These must be followed - they are based on scientific and practical consensus:

1. **Overflow Management Required:** All water storage systems must have overflow management. Uncontrolled overflow can cause erosion and flooding.

2. **Water Quality Protection:** Storage systems must protect water quality. Contaminated water can harm plants, soil, and ecosystem health.

3. **Legal Compliance:** All water storage structures must comply with local regulations. Permits may be required for larger structures.

4. **Safety:** Storage structures must be safe. Dams and large structures require proper engineering and safety measures.

5. **Maintenance:** Storage systems require maintenance to function effectively. Plan for ongoing maintenance.

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Determine Storage Needs

**Review water budget:**
- Refer to [Assess Water Needs](/restoration-playbook/water_management/restoration-playbook-water_management-01_Assess_Water_Needs)
- Identify monthly deficits requiring irrigation
- Calculate total volume needed
- Consider peak demand periods

**Storage capacity calculation:**
- Sum of deficit months = minimum storage
- Add 20-30% buffer for variability
- Consider multiple years of drought
- Balance need vs. cost

**Other factors:**
- Fire suppression requirements
- Wildlife watering needs
- Multiple use benefits
- Future expansion plans

### Step 2: Choose Storage Type

**Above-ground tanks/cisterns:**
- **Capacity:** 50-50,000+ gallons
- **Best for:** Active rainwater harvesting, near buildings
- **Advantages:** Easy installation, movable, various sizes
- **Disadvantages:** Visual impact, freeze risk, space requirements
- **Cost:** €0.50-3 per gallon

**Below-ground cisterns:**
- **Capacity:** 500-50,000+ gallons
- **Best for:** Large storage, freeze-prone areas, aesthetics
- **Advantages:** Temperature stable, hidden, no freeze risk
- **Disadvantages:** High installation cost, difficult to inspect/maintain
- **Cost:** €2-5 per gallon installed

**Ponds:**
- **Capacity:** 50,000-1,000,000+ gallons
- **Best for:** Large sites, wildlife habitat, multiple uses
- **Advantages:** Lowest cost per gallon, habitat creation, aesthetics
- **Disadvantages:** Evaporation, requires space, permitting
- **Cost:** €0.10-0.50 per gallon

**Bladder tanks:**
- **Capacity:** 100-10,000 gallons
- **Best for:** Temporary or mobile storage
- **Advantages:** Collapsible, portable, quick deployment
- **Disadvantages:** Limited lifespan, potential punctures
- **Cost:** €1-2 per gallon

**Natural features (enhanced):**
- **Examples:** Springs, seeps, natural depressions
- **Best for:** Existing water sources that can be developed
- **Advantages:** Work with nature, minimal construction
- **Disadvantages:** Limited control, variable yield

### Step 3: Site Selection for Storage

**Above-ground tanks:**
- Level, stable foundation required
- Near rainwater collection points
- Accessible for filling and distribution
- Adequate drainage away from foundation
- Adequate clearance for maintenance
- Consider visual impact

**Ponds:**
- Natural low points or areas easy to dam
- Clay soils best (or liner required)
- Adequate watershed to fill pond
- Not in floodplain or creek channel
- Soil percolation test if liner questionable
- Permit requirements met
- Safe distance from buildings

**General site criteria:**
- Gravity flow to irrigation areas if possible
- Avoid contamination sources
- Stable ground (no settling or sliding)
- Access for construction equipment
- Future expansion potential

### Step 4: Design Storage Structure

**Tank/cistern specifications:**
- Material: Polyethylene, fiberglass, concrete, steel
- Color: Dark colors for UV protection, light colors stay cooler
- Inlet size: Match to supply pipe
- Outlet: Bottom drain preferred, multiple heights useful
- Overflow: 2× inlet size, directed appropriately
- Vent: Screened to prevent mosquitoes
- Access hatch: For cleaning and inspection
- Level indicator: Visual gauge

**Foundation for tanks:**
- Gravel pad (compacted)
- Concrete slab for large tanks
- Blocking/piers to elevate for gravity flow
- Account for full weight (8.3 lbs/gallon + tank)

**Pond design elements:**
- **Dam:** If creating reservoir
  - Core: Impermeable clay
  - Shell: Compacted soil
  - Spillway: For overflow management
  - Emergency spillway: For extreme events
- **Liner:** If soil too permeable
  - EPDM or PVC rubber (45-60 mil)
  - Underlayment to protect from punctures
  - Anchor in trench around perimeter
- **Depth:** 
  - Minimum: 4-6 feet to prevent freezing
  - Optimal: 8-12 feet for cool water, less evaporation
  - Shallow shelf: 6-18 inches for habitat
- **Shape:** 
  - Irregular more natural-looking
  - 3:1 slope for stability and safety
  - Islands for wildlife if large enough
- **Inlet:** Diffused to prevent erosion
- **Outlet:** Screen to prevent clogging, fish escape

**Plumbing system:**
- Pipes sized for flow requirements
- Valves for control and isolation
- Filters to protect irrigation system
- Backflow prevention if needed
- Drain valves at low points
- Unions for maintenance access

### Step 5: Obtain Permits and Approvals

**Common permit requirements:**
- Water storage over certain size
- Dams over certain height
- Work near waterways
- Grading/excavation permits
- Building permits for large structures

**Agencies to contact:**
- Local building department
- Water resources board/district
- Environmental protection agency (wetlands)
- Army Corps of Engineers (if applicable)
- County planning department
- Homeowners association (if applicable)

**Documentation needed:**
- Site plan showing structure location
- Engineering drawings
- Hydrology report (for dams)
- Environmental review (NEPA/CEQA)
- Water rights documentation

**Timeline:**
- Small tanks: Often no permit needed
- Medium structures: 2-6 months
- Large ponds/dams: 6-18 months
- Plan early and budget accordingly

### Step 6: Construction

**Tank installation:**
1. Prepare level, compacted base
2. Install foundation (gravel pad or concrete)
3. Position tank
4. Connect plumbing
5. Test system
6. Secure and protect

**Pond construction:**
1. Mark boundaries
2. Excavate or build dam
3. Install liner if needed
4. Create inlet/outlet structures
5. Test and fill
6. Establish vegetation

### Step 7: Maintain System

**Regular maintenance:**
- Inspect structures regularly
- Clean filters and screens
- Check for leaks
- Maintain overflow systems
- Monitor water quality
- Document maintenance
