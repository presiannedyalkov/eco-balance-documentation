# Eco Balance Project Roadmap

**Current Version:** v2.0.0 (Bootstrap Model)
**Last Updated:** November 9, 2025
**Status:** Phase 1 (Bootstrap Launch) - In Progress
**← Back to Project Hub**

---

## 🎯 Vision Statement

Transform degraded ecosystems in Southern Europe through evidence-based, community-engaged, financially sustainable restoration that serves as a replicable model for global climate action - starting with a 1-hectare bootstrap pilot and scaling systematically based on proven results.

---

## 📍 Current State (November 2025)

### ✅ Completed: Documentation Phase (v1.0.0 → v2.0.0)

**v1.0.0** (October 2025)
- Initial strategic documentation created
- Large-scale aspirational model (10-30 hectares, €500k-2M)
- Comprehensive implementation guides

**v2.0.0 - Bootstrap Model** (November 6, 2025)
- **MAJOR TRANSFORMATION**: Shifted from aspirational to immediately executable
- Bootstrap approach: 1 hectare pilot, €20-30k Year 1, 1-2 founders
- 373 markdown files, 100% documentation complete
- 44 detailed implementation task guides
- AI skills framework initiated
- Version control and release management established

**Current Blockers** (Being Resolved in Parallel):
1. ~~Legal structure cost contradiction (Germany gGmbH €40k vs. e.V. €500)~~ ✅ **RESOLVED** - All documents now align: e.V./Associação recommended for Year 1-2 (€500-2k), gGmbH deferred to Year 3-5 with correct €28-35k cost documented
2. Geographic location ambiguity (Germany vs. Southern Europe)
3. Budget source confirmation (€20-30k availability)

## 🚧 Risks & Dependencies

### Critical Dependencies

**Phase 1 → Phase 2**:
- Must demonstrate measurable results to secure expansion funding
- Requires 12+ months of restoration data
- Dependent on favorable weather/conditions

**Phase 2 → Phase 4**:
- Must secure €250-500k expansion funding
- Requires published validation of methodology
- Team growth and capacity building

**Phase 3 (Platform)**:
- Independent timeline, can launch before/during other phases
- Enhances all other phases through community engagement
- Requires development resources (€60-120k + ongoing)

**Phase 4 → Phase 5**:
- Must prove financial sustainability model
- Requires replication toolkit and training capacity
- Dependent on external adopters

### Major Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Cannot secure land | Critical | Multiple search channels, flexible location criteria |
| Crowdfunding fails | High | Friends & family backup, small grants, phased approach |
| Ecological results insufficient | High | Evidence-based methodology, expert consultation, adaptive management |
| Platform development over budget | Medium | MVP approach, use free tiers, phased feature rollout |
| Community engagement low | Medium | Marketing, value proposition, gamification, authentic storytelling |
| Expansion funding unavailable | High | Prove viability at small scale first, diversify funding sources |
| Cannot find team members | Medium | Start solo, build gradually, offer equity/ownership, remote work |
| Replication interest low | Low | Focus on own site excellence, publish openly, active outreach |
