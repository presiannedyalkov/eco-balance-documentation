# Financial Projections - Adaptive Framework

**← Back to [Project Hub](/docs/intro)**

---

## Financial Planning Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Multiple pathways to financial viability, flexible to opportunities and constraints as they emerge.

**What This Document Provides**:
- ✅ Multiple financial scenarios based on different funding/timeline pathways
- ✅ Honest uncertainty ranges (not false precision)
- ✅ Clear decision criteria for choosing between scenarios
- ✅ Trigger events that shift projections
- ✅ Backup plans if primary scenario fails

**What This Document Does NOT Provide**:
- ❌ Single "guaranteed" financial projection
- ❌ Overly precise numbers (€25,273 for Year 3)
- ❌ Fixed timeline assumptions
- ❌ Commitments to specific revenue streams before proven

---

## Financial Projections: Adaptive Framework

**Vision**: Achieve financial viability for 1-hectare restoration site through combination of initial capital raise, early revenue development, and path to sustainability by Year 5-7.

**Core Requirements** (non-negotiable financial constraints):
- Minimum €8,000 to establish minimal viable site (lease + basic setup)
- No debt/loans (bootstrap approach, founders maintain control)
- Founders maintain financial security (keep jobs until project generates €30-50k/year stable)
- Operating reserve of 3-6 months expenses at all times
- Transparent financial reporting to supporters

---

## Scenario A: Fast Track (6-9 Months to Operation)

**Overview**: Major funding secured upfront (€20-30k), founders can go full-time or near-full-time, rapid deployment.

**Probability**: 10-20% (requires everything aligning well)

**Best if**:
- Major grant awarded (€20-50k)
- Successful crowdfunding campaign (€20-30k in first 3 months)
- Angel donor/patron commits significant funds
- Can leave jobs or go part-time quickly

### Fast Track Financial Projection

| Period | Investment | Revenue | Net Required | Notes |
|--------|------------|---------|--------------|-------|
| **Months 1-6** | €20-30k | €0 | €20-30k | Rapid setup: land, housing, infrastructure all at once |
| **Year 1** | €5-10k | €0-2k | €5-8k | Operations, expanded planting |
| **Year 2** | €8-15k | €3-8k | €5-10k | Infrastructure improvements, early revenue |
| **Year 3** | €10-18k | €8-15k | €2-10k | Revenue ramp-up, approaching viability |
| **Year 4** | €12-20k | €15-30k | €0-5k | Revenue covers most/all costs |
| **Year 5** | €15-25k | €25-45k | Break-even to +€20k surplus | Financial sustainability achieved |
| **TOTAL (5 years)** | **€70-118k** | **€51-100k** | **€32-63k net funding needed** | |

**Cumulative Funding Required**: €32-63k over 5 years (€20-30k upfront + €12-33k over Years 1-5)

**Trigger Events to Shift to This Scenario**:
- €20k+ grant awarded → Move to Fast Track immediately
- Crowdfunding raises €25k+ in first 30 days → Accelerate deployment
- Significant angel donor commits → Fast Track viable

**Key Assumptions**:
- Full upfront capital available (€20-30k)
- Founders can dedicate 30-40+ hr/week from Month 1
- Land secured within 2-3 months
- Early research partnerships (Year 2)
- Revenue streams develop faster

**Risks**:
- High upfront funding difficult to secure
- Founders may not be able to leave jobs
- Revenue assumptions may be optimistic

---

## Scenario B: Gradual Build (12-18 Months to Operation) - BASELINE

**Overview**: Part-time work model, crowdfunding or small grants over time, organic development.

**Probability**: 50-60% (realistic, achievable baseline)

**Best if**:
- Building gradually while maintaining jobs
- Crowdfunding €15-20k over 4-6 months
- Testing approach before full commitment
- Want to maintain financial security

### Gradual Build Financial Projection

| Period | Investment | Revenue | Net Required | Notes |
|--------|------------|---------|--------------|-------|
| **Months 1-6** | €5-10k | €0 | €5-10k | Prep phase: planning, networking, audience building |
| **Months 7-12** | €15-25k | €0-1k | €15-24k | Land acquisition, basic infrastructure, housing |
| **Year 2** | €12-20k | €2-6k | €10-18k | Expanded plantings, improvements, early revenue |
| **Year 3** | €10-18k | €5-12k | €5-15k | Continued development, revenue growing |
| **Year 4** | €12-20k | €12-25k | €0-8k | Revenue approaching cost coverage |
| **Year 5** | €15-25k | €20-40k | Break-even to +€15k surplus | Sustainable operations |
| **TOTAL (5 years)** | **€69-118k** | **€39-84k** | **€35-75k net funding needed** | |

**Cumulative Funding Required**: €35-75k over 5 years (spread gradually, not all upfront)

**Funding Timeline**:
- Months 1-6: €5-10k (prep, initial costs)
- Months 7-12: €15-25k (main capital raise via crowdfunding/grants)
- Year 2: €10-18k (operations + improvements)
- Years 3-5: €17-58k (decreasing external funding need as revenue grows)

**Trigger Events to Shift FROM This Scenario**:
- **Accelerate to Scenario A if**: Major funding opportunity emerges Month 3-6
- **Decelerate to Scenario C if**: Crowdfunding underperforms, need more time

**Key Assumptions**:
- Part-time work model Year 1-2 (15-25 hr/week)
- Crowdfunding €15-20k over 6 months (Months 4-9)
- Small grants €3-8k/year Years 1-3
- Transition to more time Year 3-4 (25-35 hr/week)
- Revenue develops gradually, conservative projections

**Why This is Baseline**:
- Realistic funding timeline (not requiring huge upfront raise)
- Maintains founder financial security (keep jobs)
- Allows testing and learning
- Flexible to accelerate or decelerate
- Achievable with moderate community support

---

## Scenario C: Slow & Steady (24-36 Months to Operation)

**Overview**: Ultra-lean bootstrap, founders contribute €8-12k/year from jobs, very part-time, maximum security.

**Probability**: 70-80% (highly achievable, lowest risk)

**Best if**:
- Risk-averse, want maximum security
- Don't want fundraising stress
- Patient, willing to build slowly
- Testing concept thoroughly before scaling

### Slow & Steady Financial Projection

| Period | Investment | Revenue | Net Required | Notes |
|--------|------------|---------|--------------|-------|
| **Year 1** | €8-12k | €0 | €8-12k | Lease land, minimal setup, founder contributions |
| **Year 2** | €8-15k | €0-2k | €8-13k | Gradual improvements, basic plantings |
| **Year 3** | €10-18k | €2-5k | €8-16k | Continued development, early revenue experiments |
| **Year 4** | €12-20k | €5-12k | €7-15k | Infrastructure upgrades, revenue growing |
| **Year 5** | €12-22k | €10-20k | €2-12k | Approaching viability |
| **Year 6-7** | €15-25k | €20-40k | Break-even to +€15k surplus | Sustainability achieved |
| **TOTAL (6-7 years)** | **€65-112k** | **€37-79k** | **€33-83k net funding needed** | |

**Cumulative Funding Required**: €33-83k over 6-7 years (€8-15k/year average, very manageable)

**Funding Sources**:
- Founder contributions: €8-12k/year from jobs (primary)
- Small crowdfunding: €2-5k/year (supplemental)
- Micro-grants: €1-3k/year (opportunistic)
- Friends & family: €2-5k total over years (one-time gifts)

**Trigger Events to Shift FROM This Scenario**:
- **Accelerate to Scenario B if**: Unexpected funding opportunity Year 2-3
- **Accelerate to Scenario A if**: Major grant/windfall Year 1-2

**Key Assumptions**:
- Very part-time (10-15 hr/week Year 1-3)
- Founders maintain full-time jobs throughout
- Minimal external fundraising (avoid stress/complexity)
- Self-reliant, patient approach
- Revenue development delayed but steady

**Why This Works**:
- No fundraising pressure or timeline
- Founders stay financially secure
- Can pause/resume as life allows
- Proves model thoroughly before scaling
- Fallback if all other scenarios fail

**Constraints**:
- Slower progress (6-7 years to sustainability vs 5 years)
- Limited scope Year 1-3
- Requires sustained founder commitment
- Revenue development delayed

---

## Scenario D: Opportunity-Driven (Variable Timeline)

**Overview**: Major opportunity emerges that changes entire financial trajectory.

**Probability**: 20-30% (unpredictable but possible)

**Examples of Trigger Opportunities**:

### D1: Partnership/Collaboration Model
- **Trigger**: Landowner offers free land + university funds research setup
- **Impact**: Reduces capital needs by €10-20k (land cost eliminated)
- **Timeline**: Could accelerate to 6-9 months
- **Financial**: Investment reduced to €15-25k total Year 1

### D2: Major Grant/Prize Award
- **Trigger**: €30-50k grant awarded (DBU, EU LIFE, prize competition)
- **Impact**: Funds entire Year 1-2 setup
- **Timeline**: Accelerate to Fast Track (Scenario A)
- **Financial**: Minimal additional funding needed for 2-3 years

### D3: Corporate/NGO Sponsorship
- **Trigger**: Company/NGO commits €15-30k + ongoing support
- **Impact**: Capital + credibility + network
- **Timeline**: Could accelerate deployment significantly
- **Financial**: Reduced fundraising stress, focus on execution

### D4: Land Donation/Gifted
- **Trigger**: Someone gifts land or extremely cheap access (&lt;€5k)
- **Impact**: €8-30k saved on land acquisition
- **Timeline**: Skip land search, accelerate to setup
- **Financial**: Redirect land budget to infrastructure/improvements

**Current Status**: Actively exploring opportunities, networking, monitoring for triggers

**Decision Process When Opportunity Emerges**:
1. Does it meet core requirements (security, control, mission alignment)?
2. What's the total commitment/timeline required?
3. Which scenario does it most align with (A, B, or C)?
4. What are hidden costs/constraints?
5. Decide within 1-2 weeks, don't overanalyze

---

## Decision Criteria: Choosing Between Scenarios

**Use these questions to determine which scenario you're in**:

### 1. Funding Availability
- **Scenario A**: €20-30k available within 3 months (grant, crowdfunding success, donor)
- **Scenario B**: €15-25k achievable over 6-9 months (crowdfunding campaign, small grants)
- **Scenario C**: €8-12k/year from founder contributions (no major external raise)
- **Scenario D**: Major opportunity emerges that changes equation

### 2. Time Availability
- **Scenario A**: Can go full-time or 30-40+ hr/week immediately
- **Scenario B**: Part-time 15-25 hr/week Year 1-2, increasing Year 3+
- **Scenario C**: Very part-time 10-15 hr/week, maintain full-time jobs indefinitely
- **Scenario D**: Depends on opportunity requirements

### 3. Risk Tolerance
- **Scenario A**: Higher risk (leave jobs, commit fully), higher reward (faster results)
- **Scenario B**: Moderate risk (part-time transition), moderate pace
- **Scenario C**: Lowest risk (maximum security), slower pace
- **Scenario D**: Variable risk depending on opportunity

### 4. Timeline Urgency
- **Scenario A**: Need/want results within 12-18 months
- **Scenario B**: Comfortable with 18-30 months to viability
- **Scenario C**: Patient, willing to take 4-7 years
- **Scenario D**: Driven by opportunity timing

### 5. Fundraising Preference
- **Scenario A**: Willing to pursue major fundraising (grants, large campaigns)
- **Scenario B**: Moderate fundraising effort (crowdfunding, small grants)
- **Scenario C**: Minimal fundraising (avoid stress, bootstrap)
- **Scenario D**: Opportunity presents funding or reduces funding needs

---

## Current Financial Status & Plan

**Phase**: Planning and opportunity exploration (Month 0)

**Confirmed Decisions**:
- ✅ Bootstrap approach (no debt/loans)
- ✅ Maintain founder financial security (keep jobs until €30-50k/year stable)
- ✅ Minimum viable investment: €8,000 (can start with this if needed)
- ✅ Target range: €8-30k Year 1 depending on pathway chosen
- ✅ Work model: Part-time Year 1-2 (15-25 hr/week baseline)

**TBD - Decision by Month 4-6**:
- [ ] Primary funding pathway (crowdfunding vs grants vs bootstrap vs partnership)
- [ ] Which scenario we're targeting (A, B, C, or D)
- [ ] Timeline (6-9mo vs 12-18mo vs 24-36mo)
- [ ] Total budget commitment (€8-12k minimal vs €20-30k standard)

**Current Approach (Months 1-4)**:
1. **Explore all funding pathways simultaneously** (don't commit to one yet)
   - Research grants (Germany, Portugal, EU)
   - Prep crowdfunding (build audience, develop campaign)
   - Network for partnerships/opportunities
   - Calculate founder contribution capacity

2. **Month 3-4: Evaluate results**
   - Which pathway showing most promise?
   - What funding level looks realistic?
   - What timeline makes sense given above?

3. **Month 4-6: Commit to scenario**
   - Choose Scenario A, B, C, or pursue D if opportunity emerged
   - Finalize budget and financial projections
   - Execute on chosen pathway

**Default Plan**: Assume Scenario B (Gradual Build) as baseline unless triggers shift to A, C, or D

### Revenue Projections (Conservative → Optimistic)

**Revenue Development Timeline - Range by Scenario**:

| Revenue Stream | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5+ |
|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| **Research Partnerships** | €0-1k | €1-4k | €3-8k | €6-12k | €10-20k |
| **Workshops/Training** | €0 | €0-1k | €1-4k | €3-8k | €5-15k |
| **Donations (ongoing)** | €0-1k | €1-3k | €2-5k | €3-7k | €4-10k |

- **Year 2**: €2-6k (early experiments)
- **Year 3**: €5-15k (starting to develop)
- **Year 4**: €12-28k (growing steadily)
- **Year 5+**: €20-45k (approaching viability)

**Key Assumptions**:
- Research partnerships primary revenue source (most aligned with mission)
- Workshops/training secondary (requires time/infrastructure investment)
- Donations ongoing supplemental (not primary strategy)
- Grants decreasing over time (not relied on long-term)
- Eco-tourism delayed until Year 3-4 (infrastructure requirements)

**Sensitivity Analysis**:
- **Conservative case** (lower end of ranges): Sustainability by Year 6-7
- **Base case** (middle of ranges): Sustainability by Year 5-6
- **Optimistic case** (upper end of ranges): Sustainability by Year 4-5

**What We're NOT Projecting** (too uncertain or not viable):
- ❌ Energy sales (off-grid system, not grid-connected)
- ❌ Carbon credits (verification costs too high for small site)
- ❌ Commercial agriculture (conflicts with restoration mission)
- ❌ Large-scale eco-tourism (requires major investment, permitting)

- Achieved: Year 7-10+ (network expansion phase)

---

## Trigger Events & Decision Points

**Triggers to Accelerate** (Shift from C→B or B→A):

### Financial Triggers
- €20k+ grant awarded → Consider Fast Track (Scenario A)
- Crowdfunding exceeds €25k → Accelerate deployment
- Major donor commits €15k+ → Shift up one scenario level
- Partnership eliminates major cost (free land, etc.) → Accelerate

### Opportunity Triggers
- Perfect land offer at exceptional price → Secure immediately, may allow acceleration
- Research institution offers multi-year funding → Consider Fast Track
- Corporate sponsorship secured → Depending on amount, shift scenarios
- Prize/competition won (€10k+) → Accelerate based on amount

### Readiness Triggers
- Founders can go full-time or 30+ hr/week → Opens Fast Track possibility
- Strong community built (500+ engaged followers) → Crowdfunding more likely to succeed
- Location/site secured faster than expected → May enable acceleration

**Triggers to Decelerate** (Shift from B→C or A→B):

### Financial Triggers
- Crowdfunding underperforms (&lt;€10k) → Shift to Slow & Steady
- Grants not materializing → Fall back to bootstrap
- Unexpected expenses emerge → Slow down, reassess
- Founder financial situation changes → May need to decelerate

### Personal Triggers
- Health/family circumstances limit time → Shift to Slow & Steady
- Job situation requires more focus → Reduce project time commitment
- Burnout risk detected → Decelerate to sustainable pace

### External Triggers
- Location decision taking longer than expected → Delays capital deployment
- Regulatory/permitting complications → Timeline extension needed
- Economic downturn affecting fundraising → Conservative approach warranted

**Decision Protocol**:
1. **Months 1-3**: Monitor all triggers, explore all scenarios
2. **Month 3-4**: Evaluate which scenario is most realistic based on what materialized
3. **Month 4-6**: Commit to scenario and execute
4. **Ongoing**: Re-evaluate quarterly, willing to shift scenarios if major triggers occur

## Financial Assumptions & Sensitivities

### Key Assumptions Underlying All Scenarios

**Funding Assumptions**:
- Crowdfunding success rate: 25-40% for environmental projects
- Grant success rate: 10-20% for small environmental grants
- Donor retention: 40-60% year-over-year
- Founder contribution capacity: €8-15k/year from jobs

**Cost Assumptions**:
- Inflation: 3-5%/year on operating costs
- Equipment lifespan: Solar 15-20 years, tools 5-10 years, housing 20-30 years
- Maintenance: 5-10% of capital value per year
- Contingency: 10-20% buffer for unexpected costs

**Revenue Assumptions**:
- Research partnership growth: 1-3 active partnerships by Year 3-5
- Workshop attendance: 20-50 people/year by Year 4-5
- Pricing: Conservative (not premium pricing)
- Ramp-up: Slow/steady (not hockey stick growth)

**Geographic Assumptions**:
- Germany costs: Land €15-30k, living €15-30k/year (founders)
- Portugal costs: Land €5-15k, living €10-18k/year (founders)
- Operating costs similar across EU (internet, solar, etc.)

### Sensitivity Analysis: What If Key Assumptions Wrong?

**If Crowdfunding Raises 50% Less Than Expected** (€8k vs €16k):
- Impact: Delay land purchase 3-6 months OR choose lease vs buy
- Mitigation: Shift from Scenario B to Scenario C
- Critical: Not project-ending, just slower

**If Research Revenue 50% Lower Than Projected**:
- Impact: Sustainability delayed 1-2 years (Year 6-7 vs Year 5)
- Mitigation: Increase workshop/training focus OR accept longer timeline
- Critical: Not project-ending, adjust expectations

**If Operating Costs 30% Higher Than Projected**:
- Impact: Need €25-40k/year revenue vs €20-30k for sustainability
- Mitigation: Develop additional revenue streams OR reduce scope
- Critical: Manageable with adjustments

**If Land Costs Double** (€30k vs €15k in Germany):
- Impact: Need additional €15k upfront OR choose lease vs buy
- Mitigation: Shift to Portugal, lease vs buy, or bootstrap slower
- Critical: Not project-ending, location/acquisition flexibility

**If Founders Can't Contribute** (€0 vs €8-12k/year):
- Impact: Must rely entirely on external funding
- Mitigation: Focus on Scenario A or B, not C
- Critical: Harder but not impossible, requires stronger fundraising

**Honest uncertainty**:
- We cannot predict exact revenue in Year 5 (range: €20-70k)
- We don't know which funding pathway will work best (exploring all)
- We don't know final location (affects costs significantly)
- We don't know founder time availability in Year 3+ (life circumstances)

**What we DO know**:
- Minimum viable investment: €8,000 (can start with this)
- Maximum realistic need: €75-85k over 5-7 years (cumulative)
- Sustainability achievable: Year 5-7 with revenue €20-45k/year
- Multiple pathways exist: Not dependent on single scenario working

**Current status**: Month 0 - Exploring all scenarios, will commit to pathway Month 4-6 based on what emerges.

**Status:** Active
