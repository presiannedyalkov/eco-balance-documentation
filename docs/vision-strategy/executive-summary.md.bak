## Vision Framework

### Our Core Vision (Immutable - This Will Not Change)

> **Our Core Vision** (Immutable - This will not change):
> 
> Create a **habitat for wildlife** and **restore land to become a shelter and sanctuary for wildlife**. Through different trees, plants, mushrooms, and diverse areas, we promote different habitats and increase biodiversity. This is our primary purpose - to provide sanctuary and shelter for wildlife in the face of climate change and mass extinction.

**This is the immutable core of Eco Balance.** All other documents, plans, and operational details can and will change as we learn and adapt. But this vision - creating a habitat and sanctuary for wildlife through biodiversity restoration - is the anchor that remains constant.

**Key Elements:**
- **Wildlife habitat and sanctuary** as primary vision
- **Different trees, plants, mushrooms** to promote diverse habitats
- **Increase biodiversity** as core goal
- **Climate change context** (manmade factors, mass extinction)
- **Sanctuary and shelter** for wildlife as fundamental purpose

### Alignment with UN Sustainable Development Goals

Our work aligns with the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**, specifically:

- **Goal 13: Climate Action** - Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts
- **Goal 14: Life Below Water** - Conserve and sustainably use oceans, seas and marine resources  
- **Goal 15: Life on Land** - Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and biodiversity loss

While the SDGs cover many important areas (17 goals total), we focus our efforts on **biodiversity conservation and ecosystem restoration** as our primary contribution to addressing climate change. This aligns our work with international climate agreements, including the Paris Agreement (2015).

### Scientific Grounding

This project **will be firmly grounded in science and scientific principles**. We **will maintain strong ties to universities and other types of climate science** institutions. We **will measure how the land is doing under our guardianship** when implementing approved plans with measures. Scientific rigor and measurement are core to our vision and approach, not optional add-ons.

### Local Integration Opportunities

We see opportunities in the **energy sector, food sector, society, and more areas** by **transitioning to more local and pragmatic sources and services**, **integrating local knowledge** into the project, and **alleviating actual local problems**. This is not just community engagement - it's about creating local solutions that address real local needs while advancing our restoration goals.

---

**This complete vision guides all our work**, from the smallest pilot site to future expansion. These elements together - wildlife habitat, biodiversity focus, scientific grounding, and local integration - make Eco Balance what it is, and they will not change.

---

**What We Want to Achieve** (non-negotiable):
- Restore degraded ecosystems to healthy, biodiverse states
- Demonstrate replicable, scalable restoration model at 1-hectare pilot scale
- Create sustainable livelihood from restoration work
- Build community around ecological regeneration
- Combat climate change through evidence-based ecosystem restoration

**How We'll Get There** (flexible, adaptive):
- **Funding**: Multiple pathways - crowdfunding (€15-25k), grants (€20-50k), partnerships, or bootstrap (€10k/year) → Exploring all, commit Month 4-6 based on what emerges
- **Location**: Flexible across Europe (Germany baseline, Portugal strong candidate, open to opportunities) → Decision by Month 6 or when compelling opportunity emerges
- **Legal Structure**: e.V. (Germany €500), Associação (Portugal €500-2k), or other EU equivalent → TBD based on location decision
- **Timeline**: 12-18 months baseline (part-time work), flexible 6-36 months based on funding and opportunities
- **Land Strategy**: Purchase (€8-30k), lease (€500-2k/year), or partnership/collaboration → Determined by budget and location

**Core Constraints** (non-negotiable):
- Founder health and financial security maintained (keep jobs Year 1-2 until project revenue stable)
- Legal and ethical operation (tax-exempt environmental nonprofit status)
- Ecological integrity (native species, evidence-based restoration methods)
- Transparency and accountability to supporters and community
- Basic security requirements (healthcare access, rule of law, safe environment)

**Current Status**: Vision clear and committed. Execution pathways flexible and under active exploration. Key decisions (location, funding pathway, legal structure) deferred until opportunities clarify (Month 4-6 decision timeline). → See [Project Roadmap](/docs/resources/roadmap) for current blockers and status.

## Project Vision

Eco Balance is a holistic environmental restoration initiative designed to combat climate change through ecosystem regeneration. Unlike conventional reforestation projects, Eco Balance takes an integrated systems approach that addresses soil health, water management, biodiversity conservation, community engagement, and technological innovation simultaneously.

Starting with a small pilot site (typically 0.5-1.5 hectares, final size depends on available land and budget) and approximately €20-30k Year 1 budget range (varies by funding pathway and location), we prove the model works before scaling. This realistic, founder-led approach ensures viability and builds credibility for future expansion.

## Vision, Reality & Planning: Three Layers

### 🌟 Vision & Future Aspirations (Long-Term Dreams)

**These are wishes and aspirations - not budgeted, not planned, but something to work towards someday:**

- **Atmospheric Water Generation**: Creating water from air using solar energy - a sustainable water source that doesn't depend on rainfall or wells
- **Water Reservoir for Wildlife**: A dedicated water feature that supports local animal populations year-round
- **Food Forest & Edible Gardens**: Integrating edible plants, fruit trees, and food-producing ecosystems into restoration work
- **Advanced Technology Integration**: Cutting-edge monitoring, automation, and restoration technologies as they become viable
- **Multiple Sites & Regional Impact**: Expanding to multiple locations and creating measurable regional ecosystem improvements
- **Policy Influence**: Using demonstrated results to influence environmental policy and land restoration incentives

**Status**: Vision layer - aspirational, not constrained by current budget or timeline. These inform long-term direction but don't drive immediate planning.

### 📍 Current Reality (What Exists Now)

**The actual state of the project:**
- **Phase**: Exploration & opportunity tracking (Month 0)
- **Funding**: €0 secured (exploring multiple pathways)
- **Land**: No site identified yet
- **Legal Entity**: Not yet formed
- **Team**: Small founder team (typically 1-2 people, may expand if additional committed founders join), working part-time
- **Documentation**: Complete planning framework (v2.0.0)
- **Status**: Ready to execute once funding pathway and location decisions are made (Month 4-6)

**This is the baseline from which we plan.**

---

### 📋 Planning for Reality (Year 1 Execution Plan)

**Immediate actionable steps to operationalize the vision into reality:**

**Year 1 Bootstrap Plan (approximately €20-30k budget range, varies by funding pathway and location):**
- Establish legal entity (e.V. or Associação, approximately €500-2k, depends on location)
- Secure small pilot site (typically 0.5-1.5 hectares, purchase approximately €8-30k or lease approximately €500-2k/year, depends on location and opportunity)
- Build basic off-grid infrastructure (solar, water harvesting, tiny house - costs vary by location, installation approach, and equipment choices)
- Begin restoration work (soil, initial plantings, baseline monitoring)
- Document learnings and results

**Decision Points (Months 4-6):**
- Choose funding pathway (crowdfunding, grants, or bootstrap)
- Finalize location (Germany, Portugal, or opportunity-driven)
- Select legal structure based on location
- Determine land acquisition strategy

**Feedback Loop**: Results from Year 1 inform Year 2-3 planning, which informs scaling decisions, which informs long-term vision refinement.

**This is the actionable plan that changes reality step by step.**

## Core Mission

To restore degraded ecosystems in Europe through evidence-based, community-engaged, financially sustainable environmental restoration that serves as a replicable model for global climate action.

> **📘 Adaptive Implementation Note:**
> Eco Balance uses a flexible phased approach starting with a small Year 1 pilot (typically 0.5-1.5 hectares, approximately €15k-€30k depending on funding pathway, small founder team typically 1-2 people working part-time) to prove the concept before scaling. Timeline adapts to opportunities: approximately 12-18 months baseline (part-time while maintaining jobs), or 6-9 months if major funding secured early (optimistic scenario), or 24-36 months ultra-lean bootstrap (conservative scenario). Final location, legal structure, and detailed methodology determined when opportunities emerge (target: Months 4-6 decision point, may accelerate or extend based on what emerges).
