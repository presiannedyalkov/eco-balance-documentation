## Our Core Vision (Immutable - This Will Not Change)

> **Our Core Vision** (Immutable - This will not change):
> 
> Create a **habitat for wildlife** and **restore land to become a shelter and sanctuary for wildlife**. Through different trees, plants, mushrooms, and diverse areas, we promote different habitats and increase biodiversity. This is our primary purpose - to provide sanctuary and shelter for wildlife in the face of climate change and mass extinction.

**This is the immutable core of Eco Balance.** All other documents, plans, and operational details can and will change as we learn and adapt. But this vision - creating a habitat and sanctuary for wildlife through biodiversity restoration - is the anchor that remains constant.

**Key Elements:**
- **Wildlife habitat and sanctuary** as primary vision
- **Different trees, plants, mushrooms** to promote diverse habitats
- **Increase biodiversity** as core goal
- **Climate change context** (manmade factors, mass extinction)
- **Sanctuary and shelter** for wildlife as fundamental purpose

### Alignment with UN Sustainable Development Goals

Our work aligns with the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**, specifically:

- **Goal 13: Climate Action** - Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts
- **Goal 14: Life Below Water** - Conserve and sustainably use oceans, seas and marine resources  
- **Goal 15: Life on Land** - Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and biodiversity loss

While the SDGs cover many important areas (17 goals total), we focus our efforts on **biodiversity conservation and ecosystem restoration** as our primary contribution to addressing climate change. This aligns our work with international climate agreements, including the Paris Agreement (2015), and provides a clear framework for our restoration efforts.

### Scientific Grounding

This project **will be firmly grounded in science and scientific principles**. We **will maintain strong ties to universities and other types of climate science** institutions. We **will measure how the land is doing under our guardianship** when implementing approved plans with measures. Scientific rigor and measurement are core to our vision and approach, not optional add-ons. This ensures our restoration work will be evidence-based, measurable, and contribute to climate science knowledge.

### Local Integration Opportunities

We see opportunities in the **energy sector, food sector, society, and more areas** by **transitioning to more local and pragmatic sources and services**, **integrating local knowledge** into the project, and **alleviating actual local problems**. This is not just community engagement - it's about creating local solutions that address real local needs while advancing our restoration goals. By integrating with local systems and knowledge, we create more sustainable and culturally appropriate restoration approaches.

---

**This complete vision guides all our work**, from the smallest pilot site to future expansion. These elements together - wildlife habitat, biodiversity focus, scientific grounding, and local integration - make Eco Balance what it is, and they will not change.
