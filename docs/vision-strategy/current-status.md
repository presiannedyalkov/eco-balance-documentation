**Phase:** Month 0 - Planning and Opportunity Exploration
**Date:** November 2025
**Philosophy:** Adaptive, opportunistic, flexible pathways to execution

---

## ✅ What's Confirmed (Decided)

### Vision & Core Approach
- [x] **Vision**: Restore degraded ecosystems to healthy, biodiverse states
- [x] **Proof of concept**: Start with 1-hectare pilot site
- [x] **Work model**: Part-time Year 1-2 (15-25 hr/week, maintain jobs for security)
- [x] **Core team**: 1-2 founders leading the project
- [x] **Geographic scope**: Europe (EU citizenship/access)
- [x] **Methodology**: Science-based, holistic, community-centered
- [x] **Financial philosophy**: Bootstrap approach, no debt, sustainable from start

### Core Constraints (Non-Negotiable)
- **Health & Security**: Founders maintain healthcare access and financial security
- **Legal & Ethical**: All operations legal, transparent, accountable

## 🔍 What's Being Explored (TBD - No Commitment Yet)

### Funding Pathway (Decision: Month 4-6)
**Current Status:** Exploring ALL options in parallel

**Options under exploration:**
- **Option A:** Crowdfunding campaign (€15-25k target)
- **Option B:** Major grants (€20-50k, DBU/Fundo Ambiental/EU LIFE)
- **Option C:** Angel donor/patron

- **Option B:** Portugal (strong candidate if opportunity emerges)
- **Option C:** Spain, France, Italy, other EU (open to opportunities)

**Decision criteria:**
1. Where is there a €20-50k grant opportunity?
2. Where can we find ideal land at affordable price?
3. Where do we find mentorship/partnership?
4. Default to Germany by Month 6 if no compelling opportunity elsewhere

→ Full details: Geographic Strategy

---

### Legal Structure (Decision: When location decided)
**Current Status:** TBD - depends on final location

**Options:**
- **If Germany:** e.V. (€500, 4-8 weeks) OR gGmbH (€40k, 3-6 months, deferred to Year 3-5)
- **If Portugal:** Associação/IPSS (€500-2k, 2-4 months)
- **If other EU:** Equivalent nonprofit structure

**Decision criteria:** What's available within budget in chosen location?

→ Full details: Site Selection

---

### Timeline (Decision: Emerges based on above)
**Current Status:** 12-18 months baseline, flexible 6-36 months

**Options:**
- **Fast Track:** 6-9 months (if €20-30k secured upfront, can go full-time)
- **Gradual Build:** 12-18 months (baseline - part-time work, organic funding)
- **Slow & Steady:** 24-36 months (ultra-lean, maximum security)
- **Opportunity-Driven:** Variable (adapt to opportunities as they emerge)

**Triggers to accelerate:** Major grant awarded, perfect land found, can go full-time
**Triggers to decelerate:** Funding slower, location unclear, more job focus needed

## ⏱️ Timeline Reality Check

### Realistic Pathways to Operational Site

**Option A: Fast Track (6-9 months) - Probability: 10-20%**
- **If:** €20-30k secured upfront (major grant or perfect donor)
- **If:** Can go full-time or significantly increase hours
- **If:** Location and land identified quickly
- **Timeline:**
  - Month 1-2: Grant awarded or donor commits → Location decision
  - Month 2-3: Register entity, begin land search
  - Month 3-5: Secure land
  - Month 6-9: Setup and first plantings
- **Status:** Unlikely but possible if everything goes right

**Option B: Gradual Build (12-18 months) - Probability: 50-60% (BASELINE)**
- **If:** Part-time work (15-25 hr/week), keep jobs
- **If:** Crowdfunding or gradual grant success
- **If:** Organic opportunities emerge
- **Timeline:**
  - Months 1-6: Prep, crowdfunding, location research
  - Months 6-9: Location decided, entity registered, land search
  - Months 9-12: Land secured, setup begun
  - Months 12-18: Operations and plantings
- **Status:** Realistic baseline scenario

**Option C: Slow & Steady (24-36 months) - Probability: 70-80%**
- **If:** Ultra-lean bootstrap (€10k/year from founders)
- **If:** Very part-time (10-15 hr/week)
- **If:** Maximum security (keep full-time jobs)
- **Timeline:**
  - Year 1: Save €10k, lease land, minimal setup
  - Year 2: Operate, upgrade, save more
  - Year 3: Buy land or expand
- **Status:** Very achievable, lowest risk

**Option D: Opportunity-Driven (Variable) - Probability: 20-30%**
- **If:** Major opportunity emerges that changes timeline
- **Examples:**
  - €30k grant Month 3 → Accelerate to Fast Track
  - Free land offered Month 6 → Skip fundraising, setup Month 7
  - University partnership → Joint timeline based on their schedule
- **Status:** Unpredictable but possible

**Recommendation:** Plan for Option B (12-18 months) as baseline. Stay flexible for A, C, or D as opportunities emerge or constraints change.

## 💪 Unique Strengths That Enable Success

### 1. Adaptive Flexibility
**Why this matters:** Most projects fail because they over-commit to one path. Our multiple-option approach means one failure doesn't derail the project.

### 2. Founder Security Focus
**Why this matters:** Maintaining jobs and health means sustainability. Many projects fail when founders burn out or run out of money.

### 3. Exceptional Research
**Why this matters:** 400+ bookmarks show deep understanding. We're not naive idealists - we know the science, challenges, and proven methods.

### 4. Holistic Thinking
**Why this matters:** Systems-level restoration is more effective and fundable than simple tree-planting. Our approach stands out.

### 5. Financial Realism
**Why this matters:** Understanding that we need sustainable revenue (not perpetual donations) means long-term viability.

### 6. Opportunistic Mindset
**Why this matters:** Willingness to go anywhere, work with anyone, seize opportunities means we'll find paths others miss.

### 7. No Premature Commitments
**Why this matters:** By deferring decisions until context is clear, we avoid costly mistakes and stay agile.

   - If bootstrap → Confirm founder contributions, plan Year 1

2. **Finalize location:**
   - Where did opportunities emerge? → Go there
   - No clear opportunity? → Default to Germany
   - Decide by Month 6

3. **Choose legal structure:**
   - Based on location chosen
   - Engage lawyer if needed
