# Tiny House and Living Infrastructure

**← Back to Project Hub**

## Living Infrastructure Philosophy

**Home is where restoration begins.** Our living infrastructure must be sustainable, affordable, and enable effective restoration work while modeling the ecological values we promote.

### Core Principles:
- **Bootstrap-First:** Minimal viable comfort, maximum restoration focus
- **Off-Grid Ready:** Self-sufficient systems from day one
- **Scalable:** Start small, expand as budget allows
- **Comfortable:** Adequate for full-time living and work
- **Sustainable:** Low environmental impact, efficient systems
- **Practical:** Prioritizes function over luxury

### Small-Scale Pilot Approach

This document reflects our **small-scale pilot approach**:
- **Housing Budget (Part of Total Year 1):** Approximately €8-12k (housing is 40% of total €20-30k Year 1 budget)
- **Scale:** 1-2 person living space (15-25 m²)
- **Timeline:** 2-6 months to establish
- **Philosophy:** Simple, functional, affordable

**What This Is NOT:**
- ❌ Luxury tiny home with premium finishes
- ❌ Grid-connected suburban dwelling
- ❌ Custom architectural design
- ❌ Multi-room permanent structure

**What This IS:**
- ✅ Functional off-grid living space
- ✅ Adequate workspace for restoration planning
- ✅ Weather-protected storage and shelter
- ✅ Foundation for long-term site development
