# Team Roles & Structure - Adaptive Framework

**← Back to [Project Hub](/)**

---

## 🎯 Team Framework: Vision + Adaptive Reality

### Vision
**What We Want to Achieve**:
- Sustainable team capacity that matches project scale and revenue
- Essential skills covered across all critical functions
- Healthy work-life balance (avoid burnout)
- Team grows organically as project succeeds

### Core Requirements (Non-Negotiable)
- **Founder financial security**: Maintain jobs Years 1-2 to cover living expenses (€15-30k/year per person)
- **Sustainable workload**: Part-time commitment that doesn't cause burnout
- **Essential skills coverage**: Restoration ecology, project management, fundraising, communications (by founders or advisors)
- **Legal requirements met**: Minimum members if legal structure requires (e.g., e.V. needs 7 members)

### How We'll Build the Team (Flexible, Adaptive)
- **Year 1-2 work model**: Part-time (15-25 hr/week), founders keep jobs for income
- **Year 2-4 transition**: Part-time to full-time based on project revenue
- **Year 4+ potential**: Full-time if revenue supports it (€30-50k/year stable)
- **Team scaling**: Based on actual growth, not assumptions

### Current Status
- **Decided**: 1-2 core founders, part-time Year 1-2, keep jobs for security
- **TBD**: When to transition to full-time (depends on revenue), when/if to hire (depends on growth)
- **Decision Criteria**: Revenue stability, workload sustainability, impact potential

- **Jobs**: Keep full-time or substantial part-time jobs (€25-40k/year income)
- **Project Compensation**: €0-€5k/year (minimal/no salary from project)
- **Best if**: Testing model, building slowly, maintaining maximum security
- **Probability**: 80% (very likely baseline for Year 1-2)
- **Status**: Committed for Year 1-2

**Option B: Transition Phase (Year 2-4)**
- **Time Commitment**: 25-35 hours/week on project
- **Schedule**: 3 days/week on project, 2-3 days/week on job (or vice versa)
- **Jobs**: Reduce to part-time (€15-25k/year income)
- **Project Compensation**: €10-20k/year (from project revenue)
- **Total Income**: €25-45k/year (jobs + project)

## 📊 Team Scaling Options: Adaptive to Growth

> **Philosophy**: Team size follows success, not assumptions. We scale when revenue and impact justify it, not on a fixed timeline.

### Option A: Stay Lean (1-2 Founders Indefinitely)
- **Description**: Founders handle all work, part-time to full-time transition by Year 3-4, no hiring
- **Cost**: €0-€50k/year (founder salaries only)
- **Pros**: Low overhead, agile, founder control, sustainable on modest revenue
- **Cons**: Limited scale, founder burnout risk if work grows beyond capacity, no redundancy
- **Best if**: Project stays at 1ha, revenue modest (€30-50k/year), founders prefer autonomy
- **Revenue Required**: €30-50k/year stable (to support 1-2 full-time founders)
- **Status**: Strong candidate if project proves viable but doesn't scale dramatically

### Option B: Add 1-2 Part-Time Helpers (Year 2-3)
- **Description**: Founders + 1-2 part-time staff (20-30 hr/week) or contractors
- **Roles**: Restoration assistant, administrative support, or community coordinator
- **Cost**: €20-40k/year additional (€10-20k per part-time role)
- **Total Team Budget**: €50-90k/year
- **Pros**: Increased capacity, specialization, still lean, manageable costs
- **Cons**: Coordination overhead, not enough for major scaling
- **Best if**: Revenue €60-80k/year, expanding to 2-5ha, need help but not full team
- **Revenue Required**: €70-100k/year stable
- **Trigger**: 6+ months of €6-8k/month revenue, workload exceeding 30 hr/week per founder consistently
- **Status**: Likely by Year 3-4 if growth materializes

### Option C: Professional Team (3-5 Staff by Year 3-5)
- **Description**: Executive Director, Project Manager, Restoration Specialist, + 1-2 support roles
- **Cost**: €120-200k/year (professional salaries)
- **Pros**: Professional capacity, can scale to 10-20ha, research partnerships, credibility
- **Cons**: High overhead, management complexity, requires substantial revenue
- **Best if**: Revenue €180-250k/year, expanding to 10ha+, major grants/partnerships secured
- **Revenue Required**: €200-300k/year stable (staff = 60-70% of budget)
- **Trigger**: Revenue exceeds €200k/year for 12+ months, clear growth path to 10ha+
- **Status**: Aspirational - only if project succeeds dramatically (20-30% probability)

### Option D: Collaborative Model (Partnership-Based)
- **Description**: Stay lean (1-2 founders) but partner with universities, NGOs, or other organizations for capacity
- **Examples**:
  - University provides students for monitoring (free labor + research)
  - Local NGO shares equipment and volunteers
  - Corporate partner funds specific roles (€20-40k/year)
- **Cost**: €0-€30k/year additional (depends on partner funding)
- **Pros**: Leverage external resources, credibility, lower overhead than hiring
- **Cons**: Requires right partners, less control, coordination complexity
- **Best if**: Strong partnerships emerge, prefer collaboration over building internal team
- **Status**: Actively pursuing partnerships, open if opportunities emerge

### Option E: Volunteer-Driven Model
- **Description**: 1-2 founders (part-time or full-time) + robust volunteer program (20-50 volunteers/year)
- **Roles**: Volunteers handle planting days, events, citizen science, community outreach
- **Cost**: €5-15k/year (volunteer coordination, insurance, materials, recognition)
- **Total Budget**: €35-65k/year
- **Pros**: Community engagement, low cost, educational impact, scalable labor for planting
- **Cons**: Inconsistent availability, training overhead, not suitable for all tasks
- **Best if**: Community engagement is core mission, founders good at volunteer management, labor-intensive work (planting)
- **Revenue Required**: €40-70k/year
- **Status**: Will build volunteer program starting Year 1, may become primary scaling strategy

**Decision Framework**: How to choose?
1. **Revenue level**: What can we sustainably afford? (60-70% of budget max on team)
2. **Project scale**: Are we scaling beyond 1ha? How much capacity needed?
3. **Founder preference**: Do we want to build a team or stay lean?
4. **Opportunities**: Do partnerships or volunteers provide capacity without hiring?
5. **Impact per dollar**: Which model maximizes ecological/community impact per euro spent?

**Current Plan**: Assume Option A (stay lean) for Year 1-2, evaluate Option B or E by Year 3 based on actual growth and revenue.

## 🎯 Performance & Accountability

### Founder Self-Evaluation (Annual)

**Key Questions**:
1. Are we maintaining healthy work-life balance? (burnout check)
2. Are we making meaningful progress on impact goals? (tree survival, hectares restored)
3. Is the project financially sustainable? (revenue trends, founder security)
4. Are we learning and improving? (skills development, methodology refinement)
5. Are we enjoying this work? (mission alignment, satisfaction)

**Process**:
- Annual review at end of Year 1, Year 2, etc.
- Honest assessment of above questions
- Decide: Continue, pivot, or sunset project based on results
- Share summary with advisors and key supporters

**Sustainability Check**:
- **If answer to #1, #3, or #5 is "NO" for 12+ months** → Serious reassessment needed
- **If answer to #2 is "NO" (no meaningful impact)** → Methodology change or pivot
- **If answer to #4 is "NO" (not learning/improving)** → Seek mentorship or training

**Decision Points**:
- **Year 1 Review**: Should we continue to Year 2? What needs to change?
- **Year 2 Review**: Is this viable long-term? Transition timeline?
- **Year 3 Review**: Scale up, stay same, or wind down?

**Transparency**:
- Share honest updates with supporters (annual report)
- If struggling, ask for help (advisors, community, funders)
- If succeeding, celebrate and scale

## 📈 Team Growth Decision Framework

### When to Hire First Person (Critical Decision Point)

**Minimum Criteria** (ALL must be true):
1. **Revenue**: €60k+/year stable for 12+ months (enough to cover salary + overhead)
2. **Workload**: Founders consistently at 30+ hr/week for 6+ months (need help, not just nice to have)
3. **Role Clarity**: Clear job description and measurable outcomes for new hire
4. **Legal Entity**: Registered nonprofit able to employ staff
5. **Founder Capacity**: Time to recruit, onboard, and manage (hiring takes 3-4 months, managing takes 5-10 hr/week)
6. **Sustainability**: Clear path to continued revenue to support salary long-term (not one-time grant)

**Trigger Events**:
- €80k+ grant secured with multi-year commitment → Consider hiring specialist
- Expansion to 5ha+ creating workload beyond founder capacity → Hire restoration assistant
- Major partnership requiring dedicated staff time → Hire coordinator

**Decision Timeline**:
- **Earliest**: Year 2 (if growth dramatic, revenue strong)
- **Baseline**: Year 3-4 (gradual growth scenario)
- **Alternative**: Never hire (stay lean, founders prefer autonomy)

**Current Status**:
- No immediate plans to hire
- Will evaluate hiring need annually
- Default assumption: Stay lean (1-2 founders) unless clear trigger
