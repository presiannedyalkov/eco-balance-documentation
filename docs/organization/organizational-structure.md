## 📊 Decision Criteria: Choosing Legal Structure

**How to choose between options** (priority order):

### 1. Location Decision (Primary Driver)
- **If Germany chosen** → Option A (e.V.) or Option B (gGmbH based on budget)
- **If Portugal chosen** → Option C (Associação/IPSS)
- **If Spain/France/Italy chosen** → Option D (local equivalent)
- **If location unclear Month 6** → Default Germany (e.V.)

### 2. Budget Available
- **€500-€2,000 budget** → e.V., Associação, or local association (Options A, C, D)
- **€40,000+ budget** → gGmbH viable (Option B)
- **Under €500** → Informal Year 1 (Option E), formalize Year 2

### 3. Timeline Urgency
- **Need entity in 4-8 weeks** → e.V. (Option A) fastest in Germany
- **Need entity in 2-4 months** → Associação (Option C) or local association (Option D)
- **Can wait 3-6 months** → gGmbH (Option B) if budget permits
- **Need to start immediately** → Informal (Option E)

### 4. Revenue Model
- **Grant and donation-focused** → e.V., Associação work well (Options A, C, D)
- **Significant commercial revenue planned** → gGmbH better (Option B)
- **Testing/minimal revenue Year 1** → Any structure or Informal (Option E)

### 5. Governance Preference
- **Democratic/community model** → e.V., Associação (Options A, C, D)
- **Founder control priority** → gGmbH (Option B) or Informal (Option E)

### 6. Scaling Plans
- **Prove concept at 1ha first** → Simple structure (e.V., Associação)
- **Plan rapid international scaling** → gGmbH (Option B) more suitable
- **Uncertain about scaling** → Start simple, can restructure later

## 🎯 Current Status: What's Decided vs TBD

**Decided** (confirmed):
- ✅ Vision: Nonprofit entity for ecosystem restoration
- ✅ Core requirements: Tax-exempt, land ownership, liability protection, founder control
- ✅ Team: 1-2 core founders
- ✅ Approach: Bootstrap, low-cost structure Year 1-2

**Actively Exploring** (no commitment yet):
- 🔄 Legal structure: e.V. vs Associação vs other (depends on location)
- 🔄 Registration location: Germany vs Portugal vs other EU (decision by Month 6)
- 🔄 Member recruitment: If e.V. chosen, need to recruit 5-7 additional members
- 🔄 Timeline: 4-8 weeks (e.V.) vs 2-4 months (Associação) vs 3-6 months (gGmbH)

**Deferred** (will decide later):
- ⏸️ gGmbH formation: Deferred to Year 3-5 when €40k+ budget available and scale justifies
- ⏸️ Detailed governance policies: Defer until structure chosen
- ⏸️ Specific registration steps: Defer until location finalized
- ⏸️ Banking and accounting setup: Defer until 2-3 months before entity formation

**Decision Timeline**:
- **Month 3-4**: Location showing most promise becomes leading candidate
- **Month 6**: Final location decision (triggers legal structure choice)
- **Month 6-7**: Begin registration process for chosen structure
- **Month 7-10**: Complete registration (depending on structure: 4 weeks to 4 months)
- **Month 10-12**: Entity operational, bank account, tax status confirmed

## ⚡ Trigger Events: Decide Immediately If These Occur

**Grant awarded in specific country** (€20k+)
- → Action: Commit to that country within 1 week
- → Action: Begin legal registration for local nonprofit structure within 2 weeks
- → Timeline: Fast-track registration process

**Perfect land opportunity in specific location** (free or very cheap)
- → Action: Secure land immediately
- → Action: Register entity in that country within 1 month
- → Timeline: Prioritize speed over perfect structure

**Strong partnership offer with established NGO**
- → Action: Evaluate collaboration vs independent entity
- → May operate under their legal structure Year 1 (avoid registration)
- → Decide within 2 weeks of offer

**€40,000+ funding secured** (crowdfunding success or major grant)
- → Action: Reconsider gGmbH (Option B) - professional structure justified
- → Timeline: Can afford 3-6 month process and capital requirement

**Location unclear by Month 6** (no strong opportunity emerged)
- → Action: Default to Germany (familiar, secure)
- → Action: Register e.V. (Option A) - low cost, fast, proven
- → Timeline: Complete by Month 8 (4-8 week process)

## 📋 Adaptation Notes

**This document describes multiple possible pathways for organizational structure.**

The actual structure chosen will depend on:
1. **Location decision** (Germany vs Portugal vs other EU) - expected Month 6
2. **Funding pathway** (€500-€2k budget → e.V./Associação; €40k+ → gGmbH)
3. **Timeline urgency** (Need fast? → e.V.; Can wait? → gGmbH or Associação)
4. **Opportunity triggers** (Grant in Portugal → Associação; Free land Germany → e.V.)

**Current approach**: Explore all options in parallel through Month 6, commit to structure when location and funding pathway clarify.

**Flexibility maintained**: Can start simple (e.V./Associação) and restructure later if scaling justifies more complex structure (gGmbH).
