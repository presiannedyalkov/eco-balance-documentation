## Technology Philosophy

**Technology serves nature, not the other way around.** We integrate innovation thoughtfully to enhance restoration effectiveness while maintaining ecological integrity.

### Core Principles:
- **Purpose-Driven:** Every tech serves restoration goals
- **Appropriate Scale:** Right-sized for our needs
- **Sustainable:** Low environmental impact
- **Reliable:** Proven technologies prioritized
- **Accessible:** Simple enough for community use
- **Bootstrap-First:** Start minimal, expand thoughtfully

### v2.0 Bootstrap Model

This document reflects our **Bootstrap Model** approach:
- **Year 1 Focus:** Essential off-grid living + basic restoration monitoring
- **Budget:** €15-20k total technology investment
- **Scale:** 1 hectare pilot site, 1-2 founders
- **Philosophy:** Prove the model before scaling

**What This Is NOT:**
- ❌ Large-scale grid-connected solar farms
- ❌ Atmospheric Water Generators (AWG)
- ❌ Advanced automation and sensor networks
- ❌ Custom software development

**What This IS:**
- ✅ Realistic off-grid living technology
- ✅ Essential restoration monitoring tools
- ✅ DIY-friendly, maintainable systems
- ✅ Affordable, accessible technology

## ⚡ Solar Energy & Off-Grid Power

### Bootstrap System Design

**Target Capacity:** 3-5 kW solar system
- **Panels:** 6-10 × 400-500W panels (3-5 kW total)
- **Battery Storage:** 10-15 kWh LiFePO4 (lithium iron phosphate)
- **Inverter:** 3-5 kW pure sine wave
- **Charge Controller:** MPPT for efficiency
- **Monitoring:** Basic voltage/current display

### Realistic Power Needs (Actual Consumption)

**Daily Power Budget (1-2 Person Off-Grid Living):**

| Device | Usage Pattern | Daily Consumption |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Laptops (2) | Variable use, not 24/7 | 100-150 Wh/day |
| Internet router | 5-10W continuous | 50-100 Wh/day |
| Starlink dish | Averages 50-80W | 80-120 Wh/day |
| LED lights | 30W × 2-3 hours actual use | 50-100 Wh/day |
| Refrigerator | Efficient model, duty cycle | 500-800 Wh/day |
| Water pump | Occasional use only | 50-100 Wh/day |
| Phone charging | 2 phones daily | 20-30 Wh/day |
| Misc devices | Tools, fans, small appliances | 100-200 Wh/day |

**Total Daily Consumption:**
- **Typical:** 1.5-2.5 kWh/day
- **Peak days:** 3-4 kWh/day (heavy tool use)

### Why System is Sized Larger Than Daily Consumption

The 3-5 kW solar system is NOT sized for 7-8 kWh daily use.  
It's sized for:

**1. Winter Production Reality:**
- Germany gets only **3-4 hours** of effective sun in December/January
- 5 kW × 3 hours = 15 kWh potential, but actual ~6-8 kWh in winter
- Ensures **2-3 kWh/day** even in worst months
- Summer overproduction compensates for winter shortfall

**2. Multi-Day Backup:**
- 10-15 kWh battery provides **5-7 days autonomy** at 2 kWh/day
- Extended cloudy periods happen (especially November-February)
- System must work **year-round** without grid connection
- Safety margin prevents deep battery discharge

**3. Peak Loads:**
- Occasional high-draw devices not in daily budget:
  - Power tools (drill, saw: 500-1500W)
  - Washing machine if added later
  - Multiple devices simultaneously
  - Workshop activities

**4. Future Modest Growth:**
- Small research equipment
- Occasional guest power needs
- Workshop tools and charging
- System sized for 5+ year life

**Reality Check:**  
Most off-grid tiny houses consume 1-3 kWh/day. Our system is sized conservatively for **reliability**, not because we use 7-8 kWh daily.

### Budget Breakdown: Solar & Power

| Component | Specification | Bootstrap Cost |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Solar Panels** | 6-10 × 400-500W panels | €1,800-3,500 |
| **Battery Storage** | 10-15 kWh LiFePO4 | €3,000-5,500 |
| **Inverter/Charger** | 3-5 kW pure sine wave | €800-1,500 |
| **MPPT Controller** | 60-100A rated | €300-600 |
| **Mounting & Cable** | Roof/ground mounts, wiring | €500-1,000 |
| **Installation** | DIY or professional help | €0-2,000 |
| **TOTAL** | Complete off-grid system | **€6,400-14,100** |

**Realistic Year 1 Budget:** €8,000-12,000 (mix of DIY + professional help)

### Installation Strategy

**DIY-Friendly Approach:**
- Research: 20-40 hours (YouTube, forums, guides)
- Panels: Ground-mount easier than roof for beginners
- Battery: Pre-built LiFePO4 units (no DIY battery building)
- Wiring: Hire electrician for critical connections
- Monitoring: Simple display, not complex systems

**Professional Help Where Needed:**
- Electrical code compliance
- Final AC connections
- System commissioning
- Safety inspection

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks part-time work + 1-2 days professional help

### Expansion Path (Years 2-3)

**Optional Upgrades:**
- Add 2-4 more panels (€600-1,400) if usage increases
- Second battery bank (€3,000-5,500) for more autonomy
- Generator backup (€500-1,500) for extreme scenarios

**NOT Planned:**
- ❌ Grid connection (complex, expensive permitting)
- ❌ Feed-in tariffs (not viable at 3-5 kW scale)
- ❌ Agrivoltaics (interesting but not Year 1 priority)

## 💧 Water Systems

### Bootstrap Water Strategy

**Philosophy:** Rainwater harvesting is the primary water source, supplemented by emergency delivery if needed. No expensive, energy-intensive technology required.

### Rainwater Harvesting

**System Design:**

1. **Collection:**
   - Roof catchment from tiny house (20-30 m²)
   - Gutters and downspouts
   - First-flush diverter (removes initial dirty water)
   - Germany average rainfall: 700-800 mm/year
   - **20 m² roof × 700 mm = 14,000 L/year potential**
   - Actual collection: ~10,000-12,000 L/year (accounting for losses)

2. **Storage:**
   - IBC tanks (Intermediate Bulk Containers)
   - Standard size: 1,000 L per tank
   - **2-4 tanks = 2,000-4,000 L total storage**
   - Cost: €50-150 each used, €200-300 each new
   - Stackable, modular, food-grade option available

3. **Filtration:**
   - Pre-filter: Sediment removal (€50-100)
   - Main filter: Activated carbon (€100-200)
   - Optional: UV sterilization (€150-300) for drinking water
   - Berkey-style gravity filters work well (€300-400)

**Budget:**
- IBC tanks (3×): €150-600
- Gutters & downspouts: €100-200
- First flush diverter: €30-80
- Filtration system: €200-500
- Plumbing & fittings: €100-200
- **TOTAL: €580-1,580**

### Water Usage Budget

**Daily Consumption (2 people):**
- Drinking & cooking: 10-15 L/day
- Washing & cleaning: 30-50 L/day
- Toilet (if not composting): 40-80 L/day
- **Total indoor: 80-145 L/day**

**Irrigation (growing season):**
- Nursery/seedlings: 20-50 L/day
- Establishment watering: 50-100 L/day (peak summer)
- Mature plants: Minimal (rain-dependent)

**Annual Needs:**
- Indoor: ~30,000-50,000 L/year
- Irrigation: ~5,000-15,000 L/year (seasonal)
- **Total: 35,000-65,000 L/year**

**Collection Capacity:** 10,000-12,000 L/year from roof catchment

**Gap Analysis:**
- ⚠️ Rainwater alone covers ~20-30% of needs
- ✅ Supplemented by emergency delivery (see below)
- ✅ Composting toilet reduces usage significantly
- ✅ Water-efficient practices essential

### Emergency Water Delivery

**Backup Plan:**
- Local water delivery services
- Cost: €50-150 per 1,000 L delivered
- Frequency: Every 2-4 weeks initially
- Annual cost: €1,000-3,000 depending on usage

**Long-term (Years 2-3):**
- Drill well if aquifer available (€3,000-8,000)
- Expand rainwater catchment (additional roofs, tarps)
- Greywater recycling system (€500-1,500)

### What We're NOT Doing (And Why)

**❌ Atmospheric Water Generator (AWG):**
- Cost: €15,000-30,000
- Energy-intensive: 5-10 kW solar just for water
- Produces: 100-500 L/day (still not enough)
- Complex: High maintenance, technical expertise needed
- **Verdict:** Not viable for bootstrap budget or scale

**Why Rainwater + Delivery Makes Sense:**
- Total cost: €1,500-5,000 Year 1 (vs €15k+ for AWG)
- Simple, proven, low-maintenance
- Expandable as budget allows
- Works with existing infrastructure
- Emergency delivery covers gaps affordably
