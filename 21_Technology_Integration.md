## Technology Philosophy

**Technology serves nature, not the other way around.** We integrate innovation thoughtfully to enhance restoration effectiveness while maintaining ecological integrity.

### Core Principles:
- **Purpose-Driven:** Every tech serves restoration goals
- **Appropriate Scale:** Right-sized for our needs
- **Sustainable:** Low environmental impact
- **Reliable:** Proven technologies prioritized
- **Accessible:** Simple enough for community use
- **Bootstrap-First:** Start minimal, expand thoughtfully
- **Adaptive:** Technology choices match budget and location realities

### Adaptive Technology Framework

**Vision**: Reliable off-grid infrastructure supporting restoration work and comfortable living

**Core Requirements** (non-negotiable):
- Safe, code-compliant installations (no fire/shock hazards)
- Sufficient power/water for basic living and essential restoration work
- Maintainable by founders (DIY-friendly or local service available)
- Within available budget constraints
- Low ongoing operational costs

**Flexibility Principles**:
- Budget determines technology tier (minimal → comprehensive)
- Location determines water/climate strategies (temperate vs Mediterranean)
- Defer exact specifications until site and budget confirmed
- Start minimal, expand based on actual needs vs assumptions

---

### Climate-Adaptive Water Strategies

Water systems must adapt to location rainfall patterns:

#### **TEMPERATE CLIMATE** (Germany, Northern France, etc.)

**Climate Data**:
- Rainfall: 700-800 mm/year
- Distribution: Year-round, slight summer low
- Challenges: Winter freeze (storage protection needed)

**Rainwater Potential** (20 m² roof catchment):
- 20 m² × 700 mm = 14,000 L/year theoretical
- Actual collection: 10,000-12,000 L/year (accounting for losses)

#### **MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE** (Portugal, Spain, Southern France, Italy)

**Climate Data**:
- Rainfall: 400-600 mm/year
- Distribution: Winter-focused (Oct-Mar), summer drought
- Challenges: Summer deficit, intense storms, high evaporation

**Rainwater Potential** (20 m² roof catchment):
- 20 m² × 500 mm = 10,000 L/year theoretical
- Actual collection: 7,000-9,000 L/year (accounting for losses)

---

### Water Usage Budget (Location-Independent)

**Daily Consumption (2 people)**:
- Drinking & cooking: 10-15 L/day

**Irrigation (Growing Season)**:
- Nursery/seedlings: 20-50 L/day (3-4 months)
- Establishment watering: 50-100 L/day (peak summer, 2-3 months)
- Mature plants: Minimal (rain-dependent)

### Water Decision Criteria

**Choose between options based on**:

1. **Location climate?**
   - Temperate (700mm+) → Option A, C, D, or E
   - Mediterranean (400-600mm) → Option B, C, or D (rainwater alone insufficient)

2. **Is municipal water or well possible at site?**
   - Municipal accessible + connection < €2k → Option D strong candidate
   - Aquifer confirmed + budget €5-10k → Option C eliminates delivery costs
   - Neither → Must use rainwater + delivery (A, B, or E)

3. **What's water setup budget?**
   - < €2k → Option A or B (basic rainwater + delivery)
   - €2-5k → Option C (well) or E (expanded rainwater)
   - < €1k → May need delivery-only Year 1, add rainwater Year 2

4. **Can tolerate ongoing delivery costs?**
   - Yes (€1-3k/year acceptable) → Options A or B simple and low upfront
   - No (prefer higher upfront, low ongoing) → Option C (well) if possible

5. **Long-term plan (5+ years)?**
   - Yes → Option C (well) worth investment
   - No (testing 1-2 years) → Options A/B (low commitment)

**Current Status**:
- **Decided**: Need water system capable of 20-40k L/year for 2 people + restoration
- **TBD**: Exact option (A/B/C/D/E) pending site selection and climate
- **Most Likely**: Option A (temperate) or B (Mediterranean) with rainwater + delivery
- **Decision timing**: Finalize within 2 weeks of site selection (geological survey for well, municipal access check)

### What We're NOT Doing (And Why)

**❌ Atmospheric Water Generator (AWG)**:
- Cost: €15,000-30,000 (10-20× rainwater cost)
- Energy: 5-10 kW solar required (doubles solar budget)
- Output: 100-500 L/day (still insufficient for all needs)
- Complexity: High maintenance, technical expertise
- **Verdict**: Not viable at bootstrap scale

**❌ Desalination**:
- Only relevant for coastal brackish/saltwater (site-dependent)
- Cost: €5,000-15,000 for small system
- Energy-intensive (high solar requirement)
- **Verdict**: Not applicable unless coastal site with no other water source

**Why Rainwater + Delivery (or Well) Makes Sense**:
- Total cost: €1,000-5,000 setup vs €15k+ for AWG
- Simple, proven, maintainable
- Expandable as budget allows (add tanks, larger catchment)
- Works with existing infrastructure

### Monitoring Decision Criteria

1. **What's Year 1 budget after land and infrastructure?**
   - < €15k total → Tier 1 only
   - €15-25k total → Tier 1, consider Tier 2 in Year 2
   - €25k+ or grant → Tier 2 immediately, Tier 3 if grant specifies

2. **Who is primary audience for data?**
   - Public/donors (social media, blog) → Tier 1 sufficient
   - Grant funders, scientific credibility → Tier 2 needed
   - Research publication, carbon credits → Tier 3 required

3. **Is university/research partnership possible?**
   - Yes → Partner may provide Tier 2/3 equipment/expertise (cost-sharing)
   - No → Budget determines tier

4. **Founders' monitoring experience?**
   - Beginner → Tier 1 (learn first year, upgrade later)
   - Some experience → Tier 2 viable
   - Expert or partnered → Tier 3 possible

**Current Status**:
- **Year 1**: Tier 1 essential monitoring (€200-800)
- **Year 2-3**: Upgrade to Tier 2 if revenue €5-10k/year or grant awarded
- **Tier 3**: Only if partnership/grant provides funding and expertise

**Detailed Equipment Specs**: Deferred until tier selected and budget confirmed

### Decision Framework: Which Technology Scenario?

**Determined by**:
1. **Total budget after land purchase?** → Dictates scenario (A/B/C)
2. **Location climate?** → Temperate vs Mediterranean water strategy
3. **Site conditions?** → Grid access? Well possible? Municipal water?
4. **Timeline commitment?** → 1-2 years (lean toward A), 5+ years (justify C)

**Current Status**:
- **Planning for Scenario B** (€15-20k, standard bootstrap) as baseline
- **Flexible to Scenario A** if crowdfunding falls short
- **Flexible to Scenario C** if major grant or crowdfunding exceeds expectations
- **Final technology decisions**: Deferred until total budget and site confirmed (Month 6-9)

---

## 🔄 Adaptation Philosophy

**This document presents OPTIONS, not a fixed plan.**

**Technology decisions adapt to**:
- **Budget reality**: What funding actually materializes (crowdfunding/grant/bootstrap)
- **Site conditions**: Grid access, aquifer, municipal water, mobile coverage
- **Location climate**: Temperate vs Mediterranean (water, solar production)
- **Founders' skills**: DIY capability vs need for professional installation
- **Partnerships**: University/NGO may provide monitoring equipment
- **Year 1 learnings**: Actual power/water usage may differ from estimates

**Defer detailed specifications** until:
- Total budget confirmed (Month 6-9 after fundraising)
- Site selected and surveyed (geological, infrastructure access assessed)
- Location/climate determined (temperate vs Mediterranean)

**At that point**:
- Select solar option (A/B/C/D) based on budget and site
- Select water option (A/B/C/D/E) based on climate, budget, site conditions
- Choose internet (Starlink vs mobile vs hybrid) based on coverage testing
- Determine monitoring tier (1/2/3) based on budget and audience
- Purchase specific equipment based on best available products at that time

**Current Status**: Framework established, specific decisions TBD when context clarifies
