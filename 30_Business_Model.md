## Business Model Philosophy

**Bootstrap first, scale second.** Eco Balance begins as a **proof-of-concept pilot** focused on demonstrating viable restoration methodology before pursuing revenue generation or expansion.

### v2.0 Bootstrap Model Principles:

- **Year 1 Focus:** Establish off-grid living + begin restoration (€20-30k)
- **Years 1-3 Focus:** Prove the model works (€50-75k total)
- **Years 3-5 Focus:** Begin revenue generation + prepare for replication
- **Years 5+:** Network expansion + financial sustainability

**What This Model Is NOT:**
- ❌ Immediate revenue generation
- ❌ Multi-site expansion from Year 1
- ❌ Large team operations
- ❌ Complex commercial activities

**What This Model IS:**
- ✅ Viable proof of concept
- ✅ Founder-led bootstrap operation
- ✅ Crowdfunding + small grants focus
- ✅ Research partnership foundation
- ✅ Path to sustainability by Year 5

### Year 5+ Revenue Target: €20-40k/year

**Realistic Year 5 Breakdown:**

| Revenue Stream | Conservative | Optimistic |
|----------------|--------------|------------|
| Research Partnerships | €8-12k | €12-18k |
| Education/Training | €4-8k | €8-15k |

**Year 5 Expenses:** €15-25k/year (operating costs)

**Year 5 Net:** €0-20k surplus (reinvest in expansion)

---

## What We're NOT Doing (Bootstrap Phase)

### ❌ Energy Sales

**Why Not:**
- Our system is off-grid (not grid-connected)
- 3-5 kW solar is sized for our needs, not surplus
- Grid connection costs €5-10k+ (not viable)
- Feed-in tariff rates too low to justify investment

**Future Consideration:** Year 5+ if expanding to larger sites

### ❌ Carbon Credits

**Why Not Year 1-3:**
- Verification costs €5-15k minimum
- Requires 3-5 years of baseline data
- Small sites generate minimal credits
- Market prices volatile and low for small players

**Future Consideration:** Year 4-5 once we have scale and data

### ❌ Commercial Eco-Tourism

**Why Not Year 1-3:**
- Requires significant infrastructure investment (€10-20k)
- Permitting and licensing complexity
- Marketing and management overhead
- Takes focus away from restoration

**Future Consideration:** Year 4-5 once site is established
