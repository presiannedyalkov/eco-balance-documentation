# Note types
## Quick Note
The most basic type - when you click on create note it creates an untitled note in the Inbox with the tag quick_note. This note is to be processed further. The tag is queried in the daily note to see the still unorganized notes.

## Daily Note
An extensive note with many sections - queries of tasks - done and not done, last and new notes, habits and personal thoughts and other types of notes queried by tag. It gets created the first time a daily note is opened with the template daily note and the same tag. 

## Weekly Note
Not developed yet. Shows an overview of the daily notes for that week - which tasks were done, new tasks, not yet done tasks etc. The purpose of the weekly note is to do a retrospective of the week and offer perspective for the next.

## Monthly Note
Not developed yet. Similar to the weekly notes.

## Yearly note
Not developed yet. Similar to the weekly and monthly notes.

## Idea
A basic note with the tag idea.

## AI Conversation
A note with an exported AI conversation e.g. from perplexity.

# Back up
Using self hosted live sync plugin

# Use cases
## Journal
I want to have a daily page to add tasks and some text there. 
=> Added Periodic Notes with Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly Notes, Templates and folder structure.

## Interests
I have different interests (and knowledge) and I want to sort them somehow.
=> I added the PARA method for my notes to structure them in Areas, Resources and running Projects.

## Tasks
I wanted to track different type of tasks - project based as well as daily tasks.
=> With plugins like Tasker and Reminder I was able to tag and retrieve tasks from different places and organize them.
