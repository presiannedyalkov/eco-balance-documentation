# Bootstrap Model Conversion Process

## Purpose

This directory documents major strategic pivots and large-scale content conversions in the Eco Balance project. Most significantly, it contains the planning and execution documentation for the v2.0 Bootstrap Model conversion - a fundamental restructuring from a large-scale expansion-focused approach to a lean, proof-of-concept pilot strategy.

These records provide context for understanding why and how the project structure changed, serving as valuable reference for future strategic decisions.

## Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| V2_BOOTSTRAP_CONVERSION_PLAN.md | Comprehensive plan for converting all documentation to v2.0 Bootstrap Model |

## Key Documents

- **V2_BOOTSTRAP_CONVERSION_PLAN.md**: Critical strategic document
  - Use when: Understanding the shift from v1.0 to v2.0 approach
  - Contains: Rationale for Bootstrap Model, conversion strategy, implementation checklist
  - Impact: Affected every document in vault (scale, budget, timeline changes)

## The v2.0 Bootstrap Model Conversion

**What Changed:**
- **Scale**: From 5-10 hectares → 1 hectare pilot
- **Budget**: From €150-250k → €20-30k Year 1
- **Timeline**: From immediate large-scale → 3-year proof-of-concept
- **Strategy**: From expansion-first → validate-then-scale
- **Focus**: From comprehensive operations → lean MVP demonstration

**Why It Mattered:**
This conversion represented a fundamental strategic pivot based on:
- Realistic founder resource constraints (time, capital, team size)
- Risk reduction through smaller-scale validation
- Faster time-to-launch with lower barriers
- Stronger foundation for future fundraising (proven model)

**Scope of Changes:**
- 40+ documentation files updated
- All budget figures recalculated
- Implementation timelines adjusted
- Technology choices simplified
- Team structure downsized to founder-led

## Conversion Methodology

The v2.0 conversion followed a systematic approach:
1. Strategic assessment and model design
2. Comprehensive impact analysis across all documents
3. Prioritized update sequence
4. File-by-file conversion with consistency checks
5. Cross-reference validation
6. Final audit and verification

## Status

- **v2.0 Conversion**: ✅ COMPLETED (October-November 2024)
- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-08
- **Maintained**: Historical record - preserved as-is
- **Active Development**: Now occurs on v2.0 foundation
