# Documentation Standards and Guides

## Purpose

This directory contains meta-documentation that defines how the Eco Balance Documentation Vault is organized, structured, and maintained. These guides ensure consistency, maintainability, and clarity across all project documentation.

Think of this as the "documentation about documentation" - the rules, patterns, and best practices that keep the vault organized and usable.

## Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| STRUCTURE_VISUAL_GUIDE.md | Comprehensive visual guide to vault organization and file hierarchy |

## Key Documents

- **STRUCTURE_VISUAL_GUIDE.md**: Essential orientation document
  - Use when: First exploring the vault or understanding file organization
  - Contains: Complete directory structure, file purposes, navigation patterns
  - Audience: New contributors, collaborators, anyone navigating the vault

## Documentation Philosophy

The Eco Balance vault follows these core principles:

**Clarity Over Cleverness**
- Documents should be immediately understandable
- Avoid jargon without definitions
- Use consistent terminology throughout

**Modularity and Linking**
- Each document has a focused purpose
- Related content linked, not duplicated
- Clear navigation between related documents

**Progressive Disclosure**
- High-level overviews link to detailed guides
- Readers can go as deep as needed
- Quick reference alongside comprehensive detail

**Living Documentation**
- Documents evolve with the project
- Regular audits ensure accuracy
- Version control tracks changes

## Organizational Structure

The vault uses a **hybrid numbering and naming system**:

**Strategic Documents (00-99)**: Core project definition
- 00-09: Project overview and vision
- 10-19: Organization and team
- 20-29: Technical methodology
- 30-39: Business and funding
- 40-49: Implementation planning
- 50-59: Risk and performance
- 60-69: Marketing and outreach
- 70-79: Case studies and examples

**Task Directories**: Detailed implementation guidance
- Organized by functional area (reforestation, biodiversity, etc.)
- Each contains overview + specific task files
- Cross-referenced to strategic documents

**Process Directories (_process)**: Meta-documentation
- Audit, conversion, documentation, integration, planning
- Version control and change tracking

**Support Directories**: Templates, archives, maintenance
