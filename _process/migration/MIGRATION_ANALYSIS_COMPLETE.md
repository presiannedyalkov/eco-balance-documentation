## ⚠️ POTENTIAL GAPS OR CONSIDERATIONS

### Items to Verify:

1. **Source List Links**
   - Original has specific website URLs and sources
   - **Status:** ✅ Referenced in strategic docs + expanded to 400+ bookmarks
   - **Action:** No additional migration needed

2. **Specific Grant/Funder Names**
