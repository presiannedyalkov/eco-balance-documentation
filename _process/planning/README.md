# Planning Process Documentation

## Purpose

This directory contains strategic planning documents for evolving and improving the Eco Balance Documentation Vault. These plans outline future enhancements, quality improvements, and platform development initiatives that extend beyond day-to-day maintenance.

Planning documents help coordinate major improvements, ensure systematic implementation, and maintain focus on long-term documentation goals.

## Planning Philosophy

**Iterative Improvement**
- Documentation is never "done" - always room for enhancement
- Regular review identifies opportunities for clarity and completeness
- Small, focused improvements compound over time

**User-Centered Design**
- Consider different audiences (funders, partners, volunteers, public)
- Structure content for how it will be used, not just created
- Anticipate questions and provide clear answers

**Sustainable Processes**
- Plans should be realistic given team capacity
- Prioritize high-impact improvements
- Build maintainable systems, not one-time efforts

**Strategic Alignment**
- Documentation improvements support project goals
- Public platform enhances credibility and collaboration
- Quality documentation attracts partners and funding

## Planning Workflow

4. Prioritize based on impact and effort

**Creating Plans:**
