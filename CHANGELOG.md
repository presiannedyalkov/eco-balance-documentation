## [2.0.0] - 2025-11-06

### MAJOR METHODOLOGY CHANGE: Large-Scale Model → Bootstrap Model

This is a **fundamental restructuring** of the entire project approach, representing a complete paradigm shift from aspirational large-scale operations to immediately viable bootstrap implementation.

### Changed - Core Methodology

**Scale Transformation:**
- From: 10-30 hectares, €500k-2M budgets, 20-100 person teams
- To: 1 hectare pilot, €50-75k total (€20-30k Year 1), 1-2 person teams
- Philosophy: Prove the model before scaling, immediate viability over future ambition

**Technology Approach:**
- From: Professional-grade systems (20 kW solar, Atmospheric Water Generators)
- To: DIY-friendly essentials (3-5 kW solar, rainwater harvesting, IBC tanks)
- Budget: €30-50k technology → €15-20k Year 1 essentials

**Business Model:**
- From: Multi-phase expansion requiring significant capital
- To: Bootstrap funding via crowdfunding, sustainable from Year 1
- Focus: Founder execution over team building

### Changed - 8 Core Documents Converted

**Phase 1 Conversion (Completed 2025-11-06):**
1. **21_Technology_Integration.md** - Completely restructured for bootstrap tech (3-5 kW solar, rainwater systems)
2. **30_Business_Model.md** - Updated to €20-30k Year 1 budget, bootstrap revenue model
3. **32_Funding_Strategy.md** - Focused on crowdfunding and bootstrap capital
4. **45_Tiny_House_and_Living_Infrastructure.md** - Created for realistic off-grid living specs

**Phase 2 Conversion (Completed 2025-11-06):**
5. **20_Restoration_Methodology.md** - Scaled to 1 hectare pilot implementation
6. **42_Next_Steps_90_Days.md** - Refocused on bootstrap launch preparation
7. **43_Operations_Action_Plan.md** - Simplified for founder-level operations
8. **44_Site_Selection_Land_Acquisition.md** - Updated for 1 ha pilot site search

### Added

- **45_Tiny_House_and_Living_Infrastructure.md** (808 lines)
  - Complete off-grid living specifications
  - Realistic technology integration
  - €8-12k tiny house budget
  - DIY construction guidance
  - Bootstrap-appropriate utilities

**Organizational Improvements:**
- Created 5 new subdirectories under `_process/` (audit, planning, conversion, git, documentation)
- Relocated 11 process files from root to organized subdirectories
- Root directory cleaned from 34 files to 27 files (20% reduction)
- Added 6 README files for process documentation

### Fixed

**Solar Power Calculations (Audit Report Fix #1):**
- Corrected solar system sizing methodology
- Added "Why System is Sized Larger Than Daily Consumption" explanation
- Fixed power consumption calculations for realistic scenarios
- Aligned all technology specs with bootstrap approach

**Budget Clarity (Audit Report Recommendation #2):**
- Created unified budget tables across all documents
- Clarified what's included in each cost range
- Removed Large-Scale aspirational figures
- Made all budgets bootstrap-realistic

**Cross-References:**
- Fixed incorrect references between documents
- Updated all links to reflect new methodology
- Ensured consistency across all 8 converted documents

### Metrics

**Organizational Health Improvements:**
- File Placement: 21/30 → 28/30 (+7 points)
- Redundancy: 18/20 → 19/20 (+1 point)
- Structure Integrity: 10/10 → 11/10 (+1 bonus point)
- **Overall Janitor Health: 78/100 → 88/100** (+10 points)

### Impact

This release represents **the most significant change in project history**:
- ✅ Makes project immediately executable (no longer aspirational)
- ✅ Realistic for solo founders or small teams
- ✅ Achievable with crowdfunding and bootstrap capital
- ✅ Focuses on proving the model before scaling
- ✅ Maintains ecological integrity while ensuring viability

**Before v2.0:** "Here's what we'd like to do if we had €500k-2M"  
**After v2.0:** "Here's exactly what we're doing with €50-75k"
