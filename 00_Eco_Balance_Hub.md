→ See [[CHANGELOG|Changelog]] for complete version history
→ Quick start: [[QUICK_REFERENCE_GUIDE|Quick Reference Guide]]

> **📘 Current Approach:**
> This approach starts with a **small Year 1 pilot** (typically 0.5-1.5 hectares, approximately €20k-€30k budget range, small founder team typically 1-2 people) to prove viability before scaling to **5-10 hectares in Years 2-3** (approximately €250k-€500k, depends on scale and location, 3-4 staff). Implementation tasks describe full-scale methods; Year 1 focuses on core subset aligned with small-site scope.

## 🎯 Our Core Vision (Immutable - This Will Not Change)

> **Our Core Vision** (Immutable - This will not change):
> 
> Create a **habitat for wildlife** and **restore land to become a shelter and sanctuary for wildlife**. Through different trees, plants, mushrooms, and diverse areas, we promote different habitats and increase biodiversity. This is our primary purpose - to provide sanctuary and shelter for wildlife in the face of climate change and mass extinction.

**This is the immutable core of Eco Balance.** All other documents, plans, and operational details can and will change as we learn and adapt. But this vision - creating a habitat and sanctuary for wildlife through biodiversity restoration - is the anchor that remains constant.

**Key Elements:**
- **Wildlife habitat and sanctuary** as primary vision
- **Different trees, plants, mushrooms** to promote diverse habitats
- **Increase biodiversity** as core goal
- **Climate change context** (manmade factors, mass extinction)
- **Sanctuary and shelter** for wildlife as fundamental purpose

**UN SDG Alignment**: Our work aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goals 13 (Climate Action), 14 (Life Below Water), and 15 (Life on Land), with a primary focus on biodiversity conservation and ecosystem restoration.

**Scientific Grounding**: Will be firmly grounded in science and scientific principles, with strong ties to universities and climate science institutions. We will measure how the land is doing under our guardianship when implementing approved plans with measures.

**Local Integration**: Opportunities in energy, food, society, and more areas by transitioning to local and pragmatic sources, integrating local knowledge, and alleviating actual local problems.

---

**This complete vision guides all our work**, from the smallest pilot site to future expansion. These elements together - wildlife habitat, biodiversity focus, scientific grounding, and local integration - make Eco Balance what it is, and they will not change.
