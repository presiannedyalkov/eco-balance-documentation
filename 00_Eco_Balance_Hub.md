# 🌍 ECO BALANCE PROJECT HUB

**Current Status:** Exploration Phase  
**Last Updated:** November 2025

## 🎯 Vision

Create a **habitat for wildlife** and **restore land to become a shelter and sanctuary for wildlife**. Through diverse tree and plant communities, soil restoration that enhances fungal populations and mycorrhizal networks, and the creation of varied microhabitats, we build ecological resilience and increase biodiversity. This is our primary purpose - to provide sanctuary and shelter for wildlife in the face of climate change and mass extinction.

**Why this matters:** We believe in a better world and strive to create it. We want to combat the effects of climate change and bring the anthropocenic system in balance with nature. Creating space for wildlife and restoring land and habitats is how we operationalize these values.

**Approach:** Science-based, community-engaged, financially sustainable ecosystem restoration. Start small, prove the model, then scale based on results.

**Alignment:** UN SDGs 13 (Climate Action), 14 (Life Below Water), 15 (Life on Land).

## 📍 Current Reality

**Who we are:**
- Living in Cologne, Germany
- Both working normal jobs (web developer + PhD biologist at NGO)
- Both vegan, animal rights advocates
- Want to deploy our skills, time, and resources for meaningful climate action

**What exists now:**
- ✅ Clear vision and values
- ✅ Research foundation (400+ bookmarks)
- ✅ Planning framework documented
- ✅ Skills: Web development, biology, NGO experience
- ❌ No funding secured
- ❌ No land identified or acquired
- ❌ No legal entity formed
- ❌ No public presence

**Phase:** Exploring pathways forward. No commitments made yet.

**What we need:** Support to find the right ways, ask the right questions, and organize properly. We need help exploring options, not prescriptive plans with concrete dates and costs.

## 📚 Documentation Structure

This documentation contains:
- **Vision** - What we want to achieve and why (ours - our values and goals)
- **Current Reality** - Honest assessment of where we are now (gathered by us, represented here)
- **Plans & Frameworks** - AI-assisted templates that we customize with our own data and decisions
- **Operations** - Methodology and implementation approaches
- **Business** - Financial considerations and funding options

### Understanding Vision, Plans, and Reality

**Vision (Ours):**
- Our values, goals, and what we want to achieve
- The "why" behind this project
- Immutable core purpose: creating habitat for wildlife

**Plans (Created Together):**
- **Restoration Playbook** - Complete template for ecological restoration projects (44 tasks, 6 phases)
- AI provides templates and frameworks based on best practices
- We customize these templates with our own data, decisions, and circumstances
- Plans are starting points, not fixed commitments
- They evolve as we learn and clarify our path forward
- **When we start our actual project:** Copy the playbook to our project folder and customize it with our reality

**Reality (Gathered by Us):**
- Actual current state: where we are, what we have, what we've done
- Our data: location, jobs, skills, constraints, opportunities
- Represented in documentation to keep plans grounded in reality

**Note:** Throughout this documentation, you'll see plans marked as "AI-assisted templates" or "frameworks to customize." These are starting points that we adapt together with your real data and decisions. The AI's role is to provide structure and ask questions - you make the decisions and provide the data that makes plans real.
