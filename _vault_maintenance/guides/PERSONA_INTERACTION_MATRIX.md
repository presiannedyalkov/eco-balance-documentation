## Collaboration Patterns

### Sequential Workflows (One enables the other)
1. **Janitor → Auditor → Curator** - Organize, audit, enhance content
2. **Knowledge Synthesizer → Curator → Quality Inspector** - Research, integrate, polish
3. **Strategic Advisor → Implementation Coach → Curator** - Challenge, plan, document
4. **Security Auditor → Curator → Quality Inspector** - Scan, redact, polish
5. **Stakeholder Advocate → Curator → Quality Inspector** - Review messaging, enhance, polish

### Parallel Collaborations (Work together simultaneously)
1. **Auditor ↔ Security Auditor** - Completeness and security compliance
2. **Strategic Advisor ↔ Implementation Coach** - Strategy and execution feasibility
3. **Curator ↔ Stakeholder Advocate** - Content and messaging alignment
4. **Knowledge Synthesizer ↔ Strategic Advisor** - Research and evidence-based strategy

### Support Roles (Always available to others)
1. **Janitor** - Provides organization foundation for all
2. **Archivist** - Preserves work from all personas
3. **Librarian** - Makes all personas' work discoverable
4. **Quality Inspector** - Polishes all personas' outputs

## Coordination Best Practices

### When Running Multiple Personas
1. **Start with Janitor** - Clean organization enables all other work
2. **Run Auditor early** - Identify gaps before filling them
3. **Run Security Auditor before publishing** - Prevent sensitive data exposure
4. **Run Quality Inspector last** - Polish after content is complete
5. **Run Stakeholder Advocate before major releases** - Ensure messaging resonates

### High-Value Persona Combinations
1. **Knowledge Synthesizer + Curator** - Research-backed content enhancement
2. **Strategic Advisor + Implementation Coach** - Reality-tested execution plans
3. **Security Auditor + Curator** - Safe, compliant public content
4. **Stakeholder Advocate + Curator** - Audience-aligned messaging
5. **Auditor + All Personas** - Systematic completeness verification

### Conflict Resolution Priority
When personas suggest conflicting changes:
1. **Security Auditor > All** - Security and privacy take precedence
2. **Strategic Advisor > Implementation Coach** - Strategy guides execution
3. **Stakeholder Advocate > Curator** - Audience needs drive messaging
4. **Auditor > Curator** - Completeness before enhancement
5. **Quality Inspector runs last** - Polish after all content decisions made
