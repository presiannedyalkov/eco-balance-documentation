### File 5: `implementation_tasks/site_selection/01_Identify_Potential_Locations.md`

**Issues** (1 critical - geographic scope):

1. **Geographic Focus - Southern Europe Instead of Germany** - CRITICAL
   - **Location**: Entire document
   - **Current**: Focuses on Southern Europe (Mediterranean) as target region
   - **Fix Required**: **MAJOR REWRITE** - This entire file needs geographic realignment

   **Current Geographic References** (all need fixing):
   - Line ~20: "Focus on Southern Europe, particularly Spain, Portugal, Greece"
   - Line ~40: "Mediterranean climate restoration"
   - Line ~60: Examples from Spanish/Portuguese projects
   - Line ~80: EU funding specific to Mediterranean regions
   - Line ~100: Climate maps showing Southern Europe
   - Line ~120: "Target regions: Andalusia, Alentejo, Peloponnese"

   **Fix Approach**:
   ```markdown
   **NEW GEOGRAPHIC FOCUS: Germany**

   Target Region: Germany
   - Priority: Rural areas within 100-200km of Frankfurt/Berlin/Munich
   - Climate: Temperate oceanic/continental (Cfb/Dfb Köppen classification)
   - Degraded land types: Former agricultural land, abandoned industrial sites, depleted forests
   - Opportunity: Germany's commitment to rewilding and carbon neutrality

   Key Considerations for German Site Selection:
   1. **Climate**: Cool/temperate, 600-800mm annual rainfall, 4 distinct seasons
   2. **Regulations**: Strict environmental protection laws, Bundeswaldgesetz (Forest Law)
   3. **Land Availability**: Agricultural abandonment in Eastern Germany, reforestation opportunities
   4. **Funding**: German Federal Environment Ministry grants, EU LIFE Programme, regional development funds
   5. **Community**: Strong environmental movement, public support for rewilding

   **Example German Regions**:
   - Brandenburg: Affordable land, former agricultural areas
   - Saxony: Post-mining restoration opportunities
   - Rhineland-Palatinate: Forest restoration potential
   - Lower Saxony: Wetland restoration opportunities

   **German-Specific Resources**:
   - Bundesamt für Naturschutz (BfN) - Federal Agency for Nature Conservation
   - NABU Deutschland - German nature conservation organization
   - German Climate Atlas for site-specific climate data
   - State forestry agencies (Landesforstämter)
   ```

   **Additional Fixes**:
   - Replace all Mediterranean plant species examples with German native species
   - Replace Spanish/Portuguese project examples with German examples (Oder Delta, Bavarian forests)
   - Update climate data to reflect German conditions
   - Update legal/regulatory sections for German federal/state law
   - Update funding sources to German/EU programs applicable in Germany
