## Executive Summary

The Restoration Methodology document contains **8 critical assumptions** about methodology effectiveness, volunteer availability, species selection, and geographic location. The most critical issue is a **geographic contradiction**: the document uses German species examples (Oak, Beech, Birch) while the broader project vision mentions "Southern Europe" - these are different climate zones requiring different approaches. Success heavily depends on unproven volunteer mobilization (10-20 people per event) and optimistic survival rates (70-80%).

## Critical Assumptions (Priority: CRITICAL)

### 1. Geographic Location Contradiction - URGENT

**Quote**: "Example Species Mix (Germany): Oaks (Quercus robur, Q. petraea), Beech (Fagus sylvatica), Birch (Betula pendula)..." (Lines 110-118)

**Location**: Section A - Native Species Selection

**Type**: Geographic/Technical

**Assumption**: The restoration site is in Germany, using temperate forest species.

**Alternatives**:
- Current: German temperate species (Oak, Beech, Birch) - requires cool/temperate climate
- Option B: Southern European species (Cork oak, Holm oak, Mediterranean pine) - if site in Portugal/Spain
- Option C: Flexible species list based on actual confirmed site location

**Critical Question**: **WHERE is the pilot site actually located? Germany or Southern Europe (Portugal/Spain)?** This is a fundamental contradiction with File 02 (Project Vision mentions Southern Europe).

**Impact if Wrong**: Complete methodology failure - German temperate species will die in Mediterranean climate, and vice versa. €2-3k Year 1 restoration budget wasted on wrong species.

**Uncertainty**: HIGH (geographic contradiction across documents)

---

### 2. Volunteer Labor Availability

**Quote**: "10-20 volunteers × 3 events = 30-60 person-days. Provides 200-400 person-hours of planting work" (Lines 144-145)

**Location**: Section A - Volunteer Planting Events

**Type**: Community/Team

**Assumption**: 10-20 volunteers will consistently show up for 2-3 planting events per year, providing 200-400 person-hours of free labor.

**Alternatives**:
- Current: 10-20 volunteers per event (optimistic, requires strong community)
- Option B: 5-10 volunteers per event (more realistic for new unknown project)
- Option C: 1-2 founders do all work, adjust planting targets down to 50-100 trees max

**Critical Question**: Do you have an existing network of 30-60 potential volunteers in the target location? Or is this building from zero?

**Impact if Wrong**: Planting targets (100-200 trees Year 1) become impossible with just 1-2 people. Would need to reduce scope dramatically or delay timeline.

**Uncertainty**: HIGH (no existing volunteer base documented)

---

### 3. Species Survival Rates (70-80%)

**Quote**: "Expected: 70-80% survival rates" (Line 679) and "Minimum Viable Success: 50+ trees alive at end of Year 1 (50% survival of 100 planted)" (Lines 695-696)

**Location**: Section on Success Indicators

**Type**: Technical/Ecological

**Assumption**: Tree survival rates will be 70-80% with bootstrap methods (ANR, direct seeding, bare-root transplants).

**Alternatives**:
- Current: 70-80% survival (requires good conditions, proper care, suitable species)
- Option B: 50-60% survival (more realistic for first-time restoration, learning curve)
- Option C: 40-50% survival if site conditions are difficult or species mismatch

**Critical Question**: Are these survival rates validated for your specific site conditions, or are they general restoration literature averages?

**Impact if Wrong**: If survival is only 40-50%, need to plant 200-300 trees to get 100 survivors (higher cost, more labor). Could require double the €600 tree budget.

**Uncertainty**: MEDIUM-HIGH (site-specific, depends on founder experience and species match)

---

### 4. Holistic Methodology Effectiveness at 1ha Bootstrap Scale

**Quote**: "Our approach draws lessons from proven restoration projects worldwide: Loess Plateau (China), Great Green Wall (Africa), Atlantic Forest (Brazil), Gorongosa (Mozambique)" (Lines 42-46)

**Location**: Section on Philosophy - Inspired by Global Success

**Type**: Technical/Methodological

**Assumption**: Holistic 5-pillar methodology (from large-scale projects) will work at tiny 1-hectare bootstrap scale with 1-2 founders.

**Alternatives**:
- Current: Full 5-pillar approach at 1ha (reforestation + soil + water + biodiversity + community)
- Option B: Focus on 2-3 pillars Year 1 (reforestation + soil + community only, defer water/biodiversity)
- Option C: Pure reforestation focus Year 1, add other pillars Years 2-3 as capacity grows

**Critical Question**: Are the cited global projects (100s-1000s of hectares, large teams) comparable to a 1ha, 2-person bootstrap operation?

**Impact if Wrong**: Founders spread too thin trying to do everything. Better to succeed at 2-3 pillars than fail at all 5.

**Uncertainty**: MEDIUM (methodology is sound in principle, but scale-down assumption untested)

---

### 5. Rainwater Sufficiency for Establishment

**Quote**: "20-30 m² roof × 700mm rain = 14,000L potential/year. But actual harvest: ~10,000L/year. Enough for establishment watering of 100-200 trees" (Lines 341-343)

**Location**: Section C - Water Management, Rainwater Collection

**Type**: Technical/Climate

**Assumption**: 700mm annual rainfall and 10,000L harvested water is sufficient for establishing 100-200 trees during Year 1-2 dry periods.

**Alternatives**:
- Current: 700mm rainfall climate (Germany/temperate) with 10,000L harvest
- Option B: Mediterranean climate (Portugal/Spain) with 400-600mm rain = only 6,000-8,000L harvest
- Option C: Higher rainfall climate (800-1000mm) = 12,000-15,000L harvest, more margin

**Critical Question**: What is the actual annual rainfall at the intended site location? And is establishment watering truly "minimal" in Year 3+ or ongoing need?

**Impact if Wrong**: If site is in dry Mediterranean climate, water scarcity could kill most plantings. Would need larger storage (€1-2k more) or accept lower survival.

**Uncertainty**: HIGH (directly tied to unresolved geographic location)

---

## High Priority Assumptions (Priority: HIGH)

### 6. Timeline to Visible Results (6-12 months)

**Quote**: "Small Scale = Visible Results: At 1 hectare, changes are noticeable within 6-12 months." (Line 651)

**Location**: Integration & Synergies section

**Assumption**: Ecosystem changes will be visibly noticeable within 6-12 months, building credibility.

**Alternatives**:
- Current: Visible results in 6-12 months (optimistic)
- Option B: 12-18 months to noticeable changes (more realistic for tree growth)
- Option C: 24+ months for real ecosystem-level changes (conservative)

**Critical Question**: What counts as "visible results"? Planted trees surviving (yes, 6-12 months)? Or actual forest ecosystem (no, 3-5+ years)?

**Impact if Wrong**: If expectations too high, stakeholder disappointment. Need to manage expectations - tree survival ≠ forest ecosystem.

**Uncertainty**: MEDIUM (depends on definition of "visible")

---

### 7. Free/Low-Cost Methods Viability

**Quote**: "Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR) - PRIMARY. Zero cost, maximum impact. Can 'plant' hundreds of trees by protection alone" (Lines 124-128)

**Location**: Section A - Planting Strategies

**Assumption**: Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR) will be the primary planting method, producing 50-100 "protected seedlings" at zero cost.

**Alternatives**:
- Current: ANR provides 50-100 protected seedlings for free (requires existing regeneration)
- Option B: Site has minimal natural regeneration, ANR only yields 10-20 seedlings
- Option C: Site has good regeneration, ANR could yield 100-200+ seedlings (ideal scenario)

**Critical Question**: Does the intended site have existing native tree regeneration to protect, or is it degraded bare land?

**Impact if Wrong**: If no natural regeneration exists, ANR is not viable. Would need to purchase more trees (€200-500 additional) or reduce planting targets.

**Uncertainty**: HIGH (site-dependent, no site confirmed yet)

---

### 8. Research Partnerships "Free Technical Expertise"

**Quote**: "What We Get: Free technical expertise, Credibility and validation, Professional data collection, Potential small research fees (€1-3k/year Year 2+)" (Lines 742-746)

**Location**: Section on Research Partnerships

**Assumption**: Local universities will partner to provide free technical expertise, professional data collection, and potentially pay €1-3k/year for site access.

**Alternatives**:
- Current: Universities eager to partner, provide free expertise and maybe pay €1-3k
- Option B: Universities interested but no payment, just free advice occasionally
- Option C: Universities not interested (too small scale, wrong location, no suitable programs)

**Critical Question**: Have you contacted any university ecology/forestry departments in the target region to gauge interest?

**Impact if Wrong**: Without research partnerships, lose credibility, validation, and potential small revenue. Must pay for soil tests (€300+) and ecological surveys (€5-10k+) yourself.

**Uncertainty**: MEDIUM (depends on proximity to universities and program fit)

---

### 9. Biodiversity Baseline (50+ Species Year 1)

**Quote**: "Year 1 Target: Document baseline species (aim for 50+ species)" (Lines 521-522)

**Location**: Section D - Biodiversity Monitoring

**Assumption**: The site currently supports 50+ species (plants, insects, birds, mammals) that can be documented in Year 1.

**Alternatives**:
- Current: Site has 50+ species present (diverse, partially degraded)
- Option B: Site is more degraded, only 20-30 species present initially
- Option C: Site is surprisingly biodiverse, 70-100+ species already present

**Critical Question**: What is the current ecological state of the intended site? Highly degraded monoculture, or degraded-but-diverse natural area?

**Impact if Wrong**: If site only has 20-30 species, target is unrealistic. But this doesn't block project - just revise expectations down.

**Uncertainty**: MEDIUM (site-specific, requires site visit)

---

## Medium Priority Assumptions (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Soil Improvement Timeline:**
- Assumption: 10-20% organic matter improvement by Year 2, 30%+ by Year 3
- Question: Are these targets validated for the specific soil type and interventions planned?

**Community Receptivity:**
- Assumption: Local community will be supportive, welcoming, and engaged
- Question: Have you tested community interest in the target region?

**Invasive Species Manageable:**
- Assumption: Hand-pulling/cutting sufficient to control invasive species
- Question: What invasive species are present on the intended site?

**Direct Seeding Survival (4-10%):**
- Assumption: 500-1,000 seeds sown → 20-50 survivors (4-10% survival)
- Question: Is this realistic for direct seeding without site prep or irrigation?

**Event Costs (€50-200 per event):**
- Assumption: Volunteer events cost €50-200 each for refreshments and materials
- Question: Is this sufficient for 10-20 people, or underestimate?

## Top 3 Questions for User

### 1. **CRITICAL: WHERE is the pilot site located?**
**Context**: Document uses German temperate species (Oak, Beech, Birch) but Project Vision mentions "Southern Europe" (Portugal/Spain). These are incompatible climate zones.

**Required Answer**:
- Germany (temperate) → Use German species list as-is
- Portugal/Spain (Mediterranean) → Completely different species needed (Cork oak, Holm oak, Mediterranean pine, carob, etc.)
- Not decided yet → MUST decide before any methodology planning

**Urgency**: IMMEDIATE - This affects every aspect of restoration methodology

---

### 2. **CRITICAL: Do you have an existing network of 30-60 volunteers, or building from zero?**
**Context**: Methodology assumes 10-20 volunteers per event × 3 events = 30-60 person-days of free labor. This is make-or-break for achieving 100-200 tree planting target with 1-2 founders.

**Required Answer**:
- Existing network (friends, family, community group) → Proceed as planned
- Building from zero → Reduce planting targets to 50-100 trees Year 1 (founders only)
- Uncertain → Test with 1 event in Year 1, adjust plans based on turnout

**Impact**: Determines realistic planting targets and Year 1 scope

---

### 3. **HIGH: Does the intended site have natural tree regeneration (for ANR method)?**
**Context**: Primary planting strategy is Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR) - protecting existing seedlings. This only works if regeneration exists.

**Required Answer**:
- Yes, visible regeneration → ANR is viable, can achieve 50-100 "free" trees
- No regeneration (bare/degraded) → ANR not viable, must purchase more trees (€300-600 additional)
- Unknown → Requires site visit before finalizing planting budget

**Impact**: €300-600 budget difference, and feasibility of "zero-cost" primary method
