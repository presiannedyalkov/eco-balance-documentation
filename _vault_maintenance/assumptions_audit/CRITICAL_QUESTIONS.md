## 🚨 TIER 1: BLOCKING QUESTIONS (Must answer before ANY planning)

### Q1. gGmbH vs e.V.: Why spend €40,000 vs €500?

**Source**: Agents 5, 8, 10, 11, 13
**Priority**: CRITICAL - BLOCKING ISSUE

**The Contradiction**:
- **File 10 (Org Structure)**: gGmbH requires €25k share capital + €15k setup = **€40,000 total**
- **File 13 (Legal Framework)**: Confirms €28-35k for gGmbH registration
- **File 30 (Business Model)**: Lists only €1-3k for legal costs (MASSIVE UNDERESTIMATE)
- **Bootstrap Budget**: Total Year 1 budget is €20-30k

**The Math Problem**:
- If gGmbH costs €40k and total budget is €20-30k → You're SHORT €10-20k before operations even start
- If gGmbH is IN ADDITION to €20-30k operations budget → Total Year 1 need is €60-70k (not €20-30k)

**The Alternative**:
- **e.V. (registered association)**: €500 setup cost, €1-3k annual compliance
- **Savings**: €39,500 (98.75% cost reduction)
- **e.V. can do**: Tax-exempt status, receive donations, environmental work, grant applications

**Critical Question**:
1. Do you have €40,000 available NOW (separate from €20-30k operations budget)?
2. If NO, why are you planning gGmbH instead of e.V.?
3. What specific capability requires gGmbH that e.V. cannot provide?

**Impact**: Without resolution, project cannot legally incorporate OR entire budget consumed by legal costs.

### Q2. Germany vs Portugal: WHERE is this project actually located?

**Source**: Agents 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 15, 20
**Priority**: CRITICAL - FUNDAMENTAL CONTRADICTION

**The Contradiction**:

**Files saying GERMANY**:
- File 12 (Team Roles): "Primary office: Bonn, Germany" (line 355)
- File 12 (Team Roles): "Field site: Germany (temperate climate zone)" (line 356)
- File 15 (Site Selection): "Within Germany (simplifies legal/regulatory)" (line 52)
- File 20 (Restoration Methodology): Uses German species (Oak, Beech, Birch), German rainfall (700-800mm)
- File 21 (Technology): "Germany average rainfall: 700-800 mm/year"

**Files saying PORTUGAL/SOUTHERN EUROPE**:
- File 02 (Project Vision): "Initial Target: Portugal or Southern Spain" (line 169)
- File 02 (Project Vision): Lists Portugal, Spain, Southern France, Greece, Italy as targets
- Multiple files reference "Southern Europe" focus

**Why This Matters**:
- **Climate**: Germany (temperate, 4 seasons, 700-800mm rain) vs Portugal (Mediterranean, drought summers, 400-600mm rain)
- **Species**: Completely different native plants - German Oak vs Cork Oak
- **Legal**: German gGmbH vs Portuguese IPSS/Associação
- **Costs**: Land, salaries, living costs differ 2-3x
- **Restoration approach**: Temperate forest vs Mediterranean dryland - ENTIRELY DIFFERENT METHODS

**Critical Questions**:
1. **Where do you currently live?** (Germany or Portugal?)
2. **Where will the 1ha pilot site be located?** (Choose ONE country)
3. **Why register in Germany if operations are in Portugal?** (Cross-border complexity)

**Impact**: Entire methodology, species selection, legal structure, budget, and team planning is WRONG if location is incorrect.

### Q3. Budget Source: WHERE is the €20-30k coming from?

**Source**: Agents 1, 3, 4, 11, 12
**Priority**: CRITICAL - PROJECT VIABILITY

**The Assumption**:
File 30 lists "Funding Sources Year 1":
- Crowdfunding campaign: €8-15k (primary)
- Friends & family: €5-10k
- Small grants: €3-8k
- Founder savings/sweat equity: €5-10k
- **TOTAL: €21-43k (wide range!)**

**The Reality Check**:

**Crowdfunding (€8-15k)**:
- ❌ No campaign prepared
- ❌ No audience built (need 300-500 email subscribers)
- ❌ No platform chosen
- ❌ Success rate for eco-restoration: 10-30% reach goal
- ❌ Preparation time: 3-6 months

**Friends & Family (€5-10k)**:
- ❌ No confirmation of availability
- ❌ No conversations documented
- ❌ Requires 5-10 people × €1-2k each OR 2-3 people × €3-5k each

**Small Grants (€3-8k)**:
- ❌ No specific grants identified
- ❌ Application cycles: 6-12 months
- ❌ Many require legal entity first (catch-22!)
- ❌ Success rate: 10-30% for first-time applicants

**Founder Savings (€5-10k)**:
- ❌ No confirmation of amount available
- ❌ No indication if this is separate from living expenses

**Critical Questions**:
1. **Do you CURRENTLY have €20-30k available?** (In savings, confirmed commitments, pending grants?)
   - [ ] Yes, I have €20-30k in savings NOW
   - [ ] Yes, I have confirmed commitments totaling €20-30k
   - [ ] No, I am PLANNING to raise this via crowdfunding/F&F
   - [ ] No, I do not have funding secured yet

2. **If planning to raise it**: What is your BACKUP if crowdfunding/F&F/grants don't materialize?

3. **Timeline**: How long will fundraising take? (4 weeks? 6 months? 12 months?)

**Impact**: Without confirmed funding source, project cannot start. Period.

## 🔴 TIER 2: URGENT QUESTIONS (Answer within 1 week)

### Q4. Founder Capacity: Can 1-2 people ACTUALLY do all this?

**Source**: Agents 1, 3, 7, 12, 14, 18
**Priority**: HIGH - EXECUTION FEASIBILITY

**The Workload (Year 1)**:
Based on File 14 (Operations) and File 18 (Marketing):

**Daily Tasks** (7am-7pm, 12+ hours/day):
- 4-5 hours: Physical restoration work (planting, clearing, building)
- 2-3 hours: Admin, documentation, planning
- 1-2 hours: Social media, communications, donor updates
- 1-2 hours: Volunteer coordination, community engagement
- 1-2 hours: Fundraising, grant applications
- **TOTAL: 10-14 hours/day, 6 days/week = 60-84 hours/week**

**Simultaneously**:
- 2-3 social media posts/week (File 18)
- Monthly newsletter
- Quarterly reports
- Video updates
- Blog posts
- Financial management
- Equipment maintenance
- Living infrastructure (cooking, cleaning, repairs)

**Critical Questions**:
1. Are you currently working full-time jobs? (If yes, timeline must DOUBLE - 180 days not 90)
2. Do you have 12+ months savings to live on with ZERO income? (€15-30k living expenses in Germany)
3. What specific skills do the 1-2 founders have? (Restoration ecology? Construction? Fundraising? Marketing? Accounting?)
4. **What is the BACKUP if one founder gets sick, injured, or burns out?**

**Impact**: Founder burnout by Month 4-6, incomplete work, or forced to abandon project.

---

### Q5. Founder Survival: How will you live on €0-5k for 12 months?

**Source**: Agent 7
**Priority**: HIGH - PERSONAL FINANCIAL VIABILITY

**The Assumption**:
File 12 (Team Roles) states: "Year 1 Bootstrap Team (1-2 people): Minimal/no salaries (€0-€5k total)"

**The Reality**:
**Minimum living expenses in Germany** (per person, annual):
- Rent/housing: €4,800-9,600 (€400-800/month)
- Food: €2,400-3,600 (€200-300/month)
- Health insurance (required): €2,400-4,800 (€200-400/month)
- Transportation: €600-1,200
- Phone/internet: €300-600
- Misc (clothing, personal): €600-1,200
- **TOTAL: €11,100-21,000 per person**

**For 2 founders**: €22,200-42,000 in living expenses Year 1

**Critical Questions**:
1. How will you cover €11-21k/person living expenses with €0-5k project compensation?
   - [ ] I have €15-25k savings per person to live on
   - [ ] I will work part-time job (if so, reduces project hours to 15-20/week)
   - [ ] Family supports me financially
   - [ ] I plan to live with parents/family (free housing)
   - [ ] I haven't figured this out yet

2. If working part-time jobs: How many hours/week for project? (Realistic: 15-20 hours, not 30-40)

**Impact**: Financial stress → forced to quit project OR take jobs → project gets 15-20 hr/week not full-time.

---

### Q6. Timeline Realism: Can you REALLY launch in 90 days?

**Source**: Agents 4, 8, 14
**Priority**: HIGH - TIMELINE FEASIBILITY

**The 90-Day Assumption** (File 42):
- Month 1: Crowdfunding campaign + land search begins
- Month 2: Campaign runs + F&F fundraising + site visits
- Month 3: Land negotiation + equipment orders + move prep
- **Week 12: MOVE TO SITE**

**What Could Go Wrong**:
1. **Crowdfunding takes 3-6 months** to prepare (build audience, create video, test messaging)
2. **Land acquisition takes 3-6 months** (search, visits, negotiations, legal, notary, Grundbuch)
3. **German bureaucracy**: Notary appointments (2-4 weeks wait), Grundbuch registration (4-8 weeks)
4. **Equipment delivery**: Solar systems (4-8 weeks), tiny house (variable)

**More Realistic Timeline**: 120-180 days (4-6 months)

**Critical Questions**:
1. Are you working on this FULL-TIME or part-time while working jobs?
   - Full-time: 90 days is aggressive but possible
   - Part-time: Need 180 days minimum
2. What's your contingency if ANY major task takes 2x longer? (Land search, fundraising, etc.)
3. Are you willing to delay if needed, or will you compromise quality/skip steps to hit deadline?

**Impact**: Rushed decisions, poor site selection, incomplete fundraising, or timeline slips by 3-6 months.

---

### Q7. Land Price Validation: Have you LOOKED at real listings?

**Source**: Agents 4, 15, 16
**Priority**: HIGH - BUDGET ACCURACY

**The Assumption**:
- File 15: "€8,000-25,000 for 1 hectare at €8-25/m²"
- File 30: "€5k-€15k budget range (or affordable lease)"

**The Question**:
**Have you actually BROWSED land listings in your target region?**

**Action Required** (Takes 2-3 hours):
1. Go to Immobilienscout24.de (Germany) or Idealista.pt (Portugal)
2. Search for "Grundstück" 0.5-2 hectares in Brandenburg, Saxony, Rhineland-Palatinate
3. Filter by price €5-30k
4. How many results? What are real prices?

**Critical Questions**:
1. Have you done this market research? YES / NO
2. If YES: What are actual prices in your target region?
3. If NO: Are you basing budget on assumptions or actual market data?
4. **What if real prices are €30-50k?** (Would you increase budget, or choose different region?)

**Impact**: Budget insufficient for land purchase → forced to lease OR delay 6-12 months to raise more.

### Q8. Tiny House Legality: Can you LIVE on agricultural land?

**Source**: Agent 15
**Priority**: HIGH - OPERATIONAL FEASIBILITY

**The Assumption**:
File 15: "Tiny house on ag land? Technically not permanent residence. BUT: Agricultural worker housing may be allowed."

**The German Reality**:
- **Building codes vary by municipality** (Bauamt has final say)
- Many rural areas PROHIBIT permanent housing on agricultural/forest land
- "Agricultural worker housing" requires proof of commercial agriculture (not restoration hobby)
- Caravans/RVs often allowed as "temporary" but enforcement varies

**Critical Questions**:
1. **Have you called the Bauamt in your target region?** (2-3 phone calls, 30 min total)
   - [ ] Yes, they confirmed tiny house is allowed
   - [ ] Yes, they said it's NOT allowed
   - [ ] Yes, it's complicated/gray area
   - [ ] No, I haven't checked yet

2. **Backup plan if tiny house is NOT allowed**:
   - [ ] Rent nearby apartment, commute daily (adds €400-800/month = €5-10k/year)
   - [ ] Use caravan/RV as temporary (less comfortable but often legal)
   - [ ] Choose different site with existing building
   - [ ] Haven't thought about this

**Impact**: Cannot live on-site → daily commute → reduced effectiveness + €5-10k/year housing cost.

## ⚠️ TIER 3: HIGH-PRIORITY QUESTIONS (Answer within 2-4 weeks)

### Q9. Friends & Family Funding: Have you HAD the conversations?

**Source**: Agents 11, 12
**Priority**: HIGH - FUNDING VIABILITY

**The Assumption**: "Friends & Family: €5,000-€10,000"

**Critical Questions**:
1. Have you ASKED friends/family if they can contribute? (YES / NO)
2. If YES: How many people said "yes" and what amounts? (Document: ___ people × €___ each = €___ total)
3. If NO: Is this entirely aspirational?
4. **Key question**: Do you have relationships with 10-20 people who have €250-1,000 to spare?

**Impact**: If F&F funding doesn't materialize, €5-10k gap in budget.

---

### Q10. Crowdfunding Readiness: Do you have an AUDIENCE?

**Source**: Agents 11, 12
**Priority**: HIGH - FUNDING VIABILITY

**The Assumption**: "Crowdfunding campaign: €8-15k (primary)"

**Success Factors** (from successful campaigns):
- 300-500 email subscribers BEFORE launch
- 30-50% of goal PRE-COMMITTED by close network
- Professional 3-5 min video
- Active social media following (500+ engaged followers)

**Critical Questions**:
1. Do you currently have:
   - [ ] 300+ email list
   - [ ] 500+ social media followers
   - [ ] €3-5k in soft commitments
   - [ ] Crowdfunding video created
   - [ ] None of the above

2. **How long to BUILD this audience?** (Realistic: 3-6 months of content creation)

**Impact**: Launch campaign without audience → likely failure → €8-15k gap + wasted €2-5k in campaign costs.

---

### Q11. Scientific Credibility: Have you CONTACTED any universities?

**Source**: Agent 3
**Priority**: HIGH - CREDIBILITY

**The Assumption**:
Multiple files mention university partnerships, research validation, expert advisors.

**Critical Questions**:
1. Have you contacted ANY university ecology/forestry departments? (YES / NO)
2. If YES: What was their response?
3. If NO: Why assume partnerships will be available?
4. **Do you have existing relationships** with professors, researchers, or academic networks?

**Impact**: Without scientific partnerships → no credibility → harder to attract grants/major donors.

---

### Q12. Water Strategy: Delivery (€1-3k/year ongoing) vs Well (€3-8k upfront)?

**Source**: Agent 10
**Priority**: HIGH - FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY

**The Assumption**:
File 21: Rainwater covers 20-30% of needs → Emergency water delivery €1,000-3,000/year ongoing

**The Math**:
- **Water delivery**: €1-3k/year × 10 years = **€10-30k total**
- **Well drilling**: €3-8k upfront, minimal ongoing costs
- **Lifecycle comparison**: Well is CHEAPER after 3-5 years

**Critical Questions**:
1. Have you researched well drilling costs in your target region?
2. Have you researched water delivery availability and pricing?
3. **Which strategy makes more sense long-term?** (Ongoing costs vs upfront investment)

**Impact**: Ongoing €1-3k/year water costs drains operating budget indefinitely.

---

### Q13. Volunteer Availability: Do you have a NETWORK?

**Source**: Agents 9, 14
**Priority**: MEDIUM-HIGH - OPERATIONAL CAPACITY

**The Assumption**:
File 20: "10-20 volunteers × 3 events = 30-60 person-days" providing 200-400 person-hours of free labor

**Critical Questions**:
1. Do you have an existing network of 30-60 potential volunteers? (YES / NO)
2. If YES: Who are they? (Friends? Environmental groups? University students?)
3. If NO: How will you recruit volunteers in Year 1 at an unknown project?
4. **Have you asked anyone if they'd volunteer for a planting day?** (Test demand)

**Impact**: If volunteers don't show up → 1-2 founders do ALL planting → targets reduced by 50-75%.

---

### Q14. Revenue Stream Validation: Any market research?

**Source**: Agents 11, 13
**Priority**: MEDIUM-HIGH - LONG-TERM VIABILITY

**The Assumptions**:
- Eco-tourism: €75k/year by Year 5
- Carbon credits: €62.5k/year by Year 5
- Energy sales: €37.5k/year by Year 5
- **TOTAL: €175k/year by Year 5**

**Critical Questions**:
1. **Eco-tourism**: Have you researched demand in your region? Pricing? Competition?
2. **Carbon credits**: Do you understand verification process, timeline (2-5 years), costs (€5-15k)?
3. **Energy sales**: Do you understand grid connection costs, regulations, pricing in Germany/Portugal?
4. **Is ANY of this validated**, or all theoretical?

**Impact**: Revenue targets missed → perpetual grant dependency → unsustainable beyond 5-7 years.

---

### Q15. Team Skills Assessment: What can you ACTUALLY do?

**Source**: Agents 3, 7, 17
**Priority**: MEDIUM-HIGH - EXECUTION CAPACITY

**Critical Questions**:

**Restoration/Ecology**:
- [ ] Have planted trees before (100+ trees)

## 📋 TIER 4: IMPORTANT QUESTIONS (Answer within 4-8 weeks)

### Q16. Measurement Feasibility: Can you AFFORD scientific monitoring?

**Source**: Agent 17
**Priority**: MEDIUM - CREDIBILITY/REPORTING

**The Assumption**:
File 51: 50+ KPIs including complex measurements (microbial biomass, functional diversity indices, carbon sequestration)

**The Costs** (estimates):
- Soil testing (full panel): €300-800 per test
- Water testing: €150-400 per test
- Microbial biomass analysis: €500-1,500 (requires lab)
- Carbon verification: €5,000-15,000 (third-party)
- Annual audit: €3,000-5,000
- **TOTAL: €10-25k/year for full scientific monitoring**

**Critical Question**:
1. Is €10-25k/year monitoring budget realistic for €20-30k Year 1 total budget?
2. Should you focus Year 1 on simple observable metrics only? (Tree count, survival, photos)
3. **Partner with university for free/subsidized testing?** (But requires relationships)

**Impact**: Cannot credibly report results → grants/donors skeptical → credibility damaged.

---

### Q17. Marketing Capacity: Who creates content while doing restoration?

**Source**: Agent 18
**Priority**: MEDIUM - STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

**The Assumption**:
File 60: 2-3 social posts/week + monthly newsletter + quarterly reports + video updates + blog posts

**Critical Questions**:
1. Who has time to create content when 1-2 people are doing physical labor 4-5 hr/day?
2. Who has SKILLS for content creation? (Photography, videography, writing, graphic design)
3. **Should marketing be MINIMAL in Year 1?** (One platform only, e.g., LinkedIn OR Instagram)

**Impact**: Marketing plan becomes paper document never executed, OR operations suffer because time spent on marketing.

---

### Q18. Carbon Credit Viability: Do you understand the PROCESS?

**Source**: Agent 13
**Priority**: MEDIUM - REVENUE MODEL

**The Reality**:
- **Timeline**: 2-5 years to first carbon credit issuance (not Year 2!)
- **Verification**: €5-15k upfront costs for third-party verification
- **Additionality**: Must prove restoration wouldn't happen without carbon funding
- **Price volatility**: €5-80 per ton CO₂ (varies wildly by market)

**Critical Questions**:
1. Have you researched carbon credit certification standards? (Gold Standard? Verra?)
2. Do you understand additionality requirements?
3. **Are carbon credits realistic for 1-5 hectare scale**, or only viable at 50+ hectares?

**Impact**: Carbon credit revenue delayed 3-5 years beyond plan → financial model breaks.

---

### Q19. Scaling Assumptions: What PROVES the model works at 1ha?

**Source**: Agent 13
**Priority**: MEDIUM - STRATEGIC PLANNING

**The Assumption**:
After 1ha success → scale to 5-10ha → scale to 20-30ha → scale to 10,000+ha globally

**Critical Questions**:
1. **What specific metrics from 1ha prove readiness to scale?**
   - Tree survival rate? (What threshold? 70%? 85%?)
   - Cost per hectare? (Below what amount?)
   - Community acceptance? (Measured how?)
   - Funding secured? (How much?)

2. **What could work at 1ha but FAIL at 5-10ha?**
   - Founder capacity (1-2 people can manage 1ha, not 10ha)
   - Volunteer coordination (3 events/year ≠ 30 events/year)
   - Water/infrastructure complexity
   - Funding sources (€30k bootstrap ≠ €500k professional operation)

**Impact**: Premature scaling wastes €250-500k investment; or, stuck at 1ha indefinitely because proof insufficient.

---

### Q20. Risk Assessment Methodology: How did you calculate likelihoods?

**Source**: Agent 16
**Priority**: MEDIUM - PLANNING RIGOR

**The Assumption**:
File 50 assigns "High/Medium/Low" likelihood to all risks, but no methodology stated.

**Critical Questions**:
1. How were risk likelihoods determined?
   - [ ] Historical data from similar projects
   - [ ] Expert panel assessment
   - [ ] Subjective team judgment
   - [ ] No specific methodology

2. **Which risks are most likely underestimated?**
   - Community resistance? (Rated "Low-Medium" - based on what?)
   - Funding shortfalls? (Rated varies - but no funding confirmed)
   - Founder burnout? (Not even listed as risk!)

**Impact**: Misallocated resources, surprised by "unlikely" events, inadequate preparation.
