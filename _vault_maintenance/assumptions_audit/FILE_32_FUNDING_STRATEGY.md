## Executive Summary

The funding strategy document contains **8 critical assumptions** and multiple high-priority assumptions about fundraising feasibility, timeline, and source accessibility. The most pressing concerns are: (1) whether founders actually have €5-10k personal capital available, (2) whether friends/family network has €5-10k capacity, and (3) whether the 6-12 month timeline is realistic for a first-time fundraising effort. The entire €20-30k bootstrap model depends on successfully executing 5 parallel funding streams with no prior fundraising experience.

## Critical Assumptions (Priority: CRITICAL)

### 1. Founders Have €5-10k Personal Capital Available

**Quote**: "Founder Investment: €5,000-€10,000 (cash + sweat equity value)"
**Location**: Line 618, Source 4
**Type**: Financial/Personal Resources

**Assumption**: Founders have €5-10k in liquid savings or assets they can liquidate to invest in Year 1.

**Alternatives**:
- Current: Founders contribute €5-10k cash + sweat equity
- Option B: Founders contribute €2-3k cash + more sweat equity (reduce personal financial risk)
- Option C: Zero cash investment, 100% external funding (likely requires higher fundraising targets)

**Critical Question**: Do you actually have €5-10k in liquid savings available to invest without jeopardizing personal financial security?

**Impact if Wrong**: If founders don't have this capital, the entire funding model needs restructuring. The €25k target would need to come entirely from external sources, significantly increasing fundraising pressure and risk.

**Uncertainty**: HIGH

---

### 2. Friends & Family Network Has €5-10k Capacity

**Quote**: "Friends & Family: €5,000-€10,000" with "10-20 people contributing €250-1,000 each"
**Location**: Lines 327-328, 342-343
**Type**: Social Network/Financial Capacity

**Assumption**: Personal network includes 10-20 people who have both the financial capacity and willingness to contribute €250-1,000 each.

**Alternatives**:
- Current: €5-10k from 10-20 people (€250-1,000 each)
- Option B: €2-4k from 20-30 people (€100-200 each, smaller asks)
- Option C: €1-2k from close family only (safer but lower total)

**Critical Question**: Have you identified specific people in your network with capacity to contribute €250-1,000, or is this a theoretical estimate?

**Impact if Wrong**: F&F funding typically has highest success rate. If network capacity is overestimated, creates €3-8k gap that must come from harder sources (grants, crowdfunding stretch).

**Uncertainty**: HIGH

---

### 3. Crowdfunding Can Raise €8-15k (First-Time Campaign)

**Quote**: "Crowdfunding: €8,000-€15,000 (realistic for first-time campaign)" and "Our target: €10,000"
**Location**: Lines 76, 95
**Type**: Fundraising Performance

**Assumption**: First-time campaign creators can successfully raise €8-15k despite no track record, email list of only 300-500 people, and €2,500-6,150 in upfront campaign costs.

**Alternatives**:
- Current: €10k target via StartNext, all-or-nothing
- Option B: €5k target (more conservative, higher success probability)
- Option C: €15k flexible funding (lower pressure, accept partial funding)

**Critical Question**: Do you have an engaged community/network ready to support Day 1, or are you starting from zero?

**Impact if Wrong**: Campaign failure means losing €2,500-6,150 in upfront costs and delays entire timeline by 2-4 months. Also damages credibility for future fundraising.

**Uncertainty**: HIGH

---

### 4. 6-12 Month Fundraising Timeline is Achievable

**Quote**: "Timeline: 6-12 months from campaign to launch"
**Location**: Line 15
**Type**: Timeline/Execution

**Assumption**: First-time founders can execute 5 parallel fundraising streams (crowdfunding, F&F, grants, founder investment, research partnerships) in 6-12 months while also planning operations.

**Alternatives**:
- Current: 6-12 months to raise €20-30k (aggressive)
- Option B: 12-18 months (more realistic for first-timers)
- Option C: 18-24 months (conservative, lower risk)

**Critical Question**: Are you working on this full-time or part-time while maintaining other employment?

**Impact if Wrong**: Timeline delays cascade through entire project. Land acquisition delayed, operating costs continue, momentum lost. Each 3-month delay costs founder opportunity cost and may require re-fundraising.

**Uncertainty**: MEDIUM-HIGH

---

### 5. Grant Success Rate of 20-30% is Realistic

**Quote**: "Expected Success Rate: 20-30% (apply to 10-15 = 2-4 awards)" and "Target: €3,000-€8,000"
**Location**: Lines 463, 461
**Type**: Competitive Fundraising

**Assumption**: First-time grant applicants with no track record will achieve 20-30% success rate (industry average) and secure €3-8k from 2-4 small grants.

**Alternatives**:
- Current: 10-15 applications, 20-30% success rate = €3-8k
- Option B: 20-25 applications, 10-20% success rate = €3-8k (more realistic for beginners)
- Option C: Skip grants Year 1, focus on easier sources (reduce complexity)

**Critical Question**: Do you have grant writing experience, or will this be your first time applying?

**Impact if Wrong**: Grant funding takes 3-6 months per cycle. If success rate is lower (5-10% realistic for first-timers), need to apply to 40-80 grants to get 2-4 awards - unsustainable workload.

**Uncertainty**: MEDIUM-HIGH

---

### 6. gGmbH Will Be Registered Before Tax-Deductible Donations Needed

**Quote**: "Option A: Gift (tax-deductible if gGmbH registered)"
**Location**: Line 398
**Type**: Legal Timing/Structure

**Assumption**: gGmbH registration (requiring €25k share capital + €15k setup costs) will be complete before friends/family and grant fundraising begins.

**Alternatives**:
- Current: gGmbH registered early (€40k upfront cost) for tax benefits
- Option B: e.V. registration first (€500), defer gGmbH to Year 2 (save €39.5k)
- Option C: Operate informally Year 1, no tax-deductible donations (simpler, cheaper)

**Critical Question**: How can you register a gGmbH (€40k required) when you're still trying to raise the first €20-30k for operations?

**Impact if Wrong**: This is a circular dependency problem. Can't raise €40k for gGmbH before raising €20-30k for operations, but document assumes tax-deductible donations which require gGmbH. Major structural contradiction.

**Uncertainty**: CRITICAL - This appears to be a contradiction with File 10 (Organizational Structure)

---

### 7. Multiple Funding Sources Won't Interfere With Each Other

**Quote**: "Five-Source Funding Mix" executed in parallel
**Location**: Lines 57-68, 728-809
**Type**: Operational/Strategic

**Assumption**: Running crowdfunding campaign, F&F outreach, grant applications, founder investment, and research partnerships simultaneously won't create donor confusion, message dilution, or fundraising fatigue.

**Alternatives**:
- Current: All 5 sources in parallel (months 1-12)
- Option B: Sequential approach (crowdfunding → F&F → grants, 18-24 months)
- Option C: Focus on 2-3 sources max (crowdfunding + F&F + founder, skip grants/research)

**Critical Question**: Who will manage 5 different fundraising streams simultaneously - one founder or two?

**Impact if Wrong**: Fundraising fatigue, confused messaging ("Why crowdfund if you have grants?"), donor cannibalization (same people approached via multiple channels), founder burnout.

**Uncertainty**: MEDIUM

---

### 8. €20-30k Budget is Actually Sufficient for Year 1

**Quote**: "Year 1 Funding Need: €20-30k" and "Total: €23-36k"
**Location**: Lines 35, 49
**Type**: Financial Planning

**Assumption**: €20-30k covers ALL Year 1 costs including technology (€12-15k), housing (€6-10k), site prep (€2-4k), plantings (€1-3k), tools (€1-2k), and 3-month reserve (€1-2k), with no significant overruns or unexpected costs.

**Alternatives**:
- Current: €25k target covers all needs (optimistic)
- Option B: €30-35k target with larger contingency (more realistic)
- Option C: Phase 1 focus: €15k for essentials only, defer housing/tech to Year 2

**Critical Question**: Does the €20-30k include the €40k needed for gGmbH registration (€25k capital + €15k setup)?

**Impact if Wrong**: Budget shortfalls mid-Year 1 force emergency fundraising, project delays, or scope reduction. Credibility damaged with early supporters if you need to ask for more.

**Uncertainty**: HIGH - Contradicts gGmbH capital requirements in File 10

---

## High Priority Assumptions (Priority: HIGH)

### 9. StartNext Platform is Optimal Choice

**Assumption**: StartNext (German platform, 4-5% fees) is better than Kickstarter (international, 8-10% fees) or Betterplace (€0 fees for gGmbH).

**Location**: Lines 99-120

**Critical Question**: Why not use Betterplace with zero fees if you're planning gGmbH registration anyway?

**Impact if Wrong**: Paying €400-750 in platform fees unnecessarily when zero-fee alternative exists.

**Uncertainty**: MEDIUM

---

### 10. Email List of 300-500 People is Achievable Pre-Launch

**Assumption**: "Target: 300-500 people pre-launch" can be built in 4 weeks before crowdfunding launch.

**Location**: Line 271

**Critical Question**: Do you currently have a mailing list or social media following, or starting from zero?

**Impact if Wrong**: Crowdfunding campaigns with <100 email subscribers have <10% success rate. Need 6-12 months of audience building before campaign launch.

**Uncertainty**: MEDIUM

---

### 11. First 48 Hours Determines Campaign Success

**Assumption**: "First 48 hours determine success" with 30% of goal (€3,000) needed in Week 1.

**Location**: Lines 306-307, 233

**Critical Question**: Do you have committed Day 1 backers lined up, or hoping to build momentum organically?

**Impact if Wrong**: Slow starts rarely recover. If Week 1 < 20% of goal, success rate drops to <15%.

**Uncertainty**: MEDIUM

---

### 12. Video Production Can Be Done for €500-1,500 (DIY)

**Assumption**: Founders can create professional-quality 3-5 minute campaign video for €500-1,500 using DIY approach with quality camera rental.

**Location**: Lines 184, 289

**Critical Question**: Do you have video production/editing skills, or will you need to hire professionals?

**Impact if Wrong**: Professional video production costs €2,000-5,000. Budget underestimates by 100-200%.

**Uncertainty**: MEDIUM

---

### 13. Research Partnerships Possible in Year 1

**Assumption**: University partnerships can generate €1-3k in Year 1 despite no track record or established site.

**Location**: Lines 681, 696

**Critical Question**: Have you made contact with any university researchers, or is this aspirational?

**Impact if Wrong**: Research partnerships typically take 6-18 months to establish. Year 1 revenue likely €0.

**Uncertainty**: MEDIUM

---

## Medium Priority Assumptions (Priority: MEDIUM)

- **Campaign costs can be kept under €3,000**: Assumes significant DIY work and low-cost solutions (Lines 192-197)
- **Monthly updates sufficient for backer retention**: Assumes quarterly video + monthly email keeps donors engaged (Lines 447-450)
- **Local grants have 30-40% success rate**: Higher than national grants (20-30%), assumes local preference bias (Line 494)
- **Personal networks include 20-30 viable prospects**: Assumes founder social capital (Line 355)
- **All-or-nothing crowdfunding builds urgency**: Assumes this model better than flexible funding (Line 128)
- **Social media ads €500-1,500 sufficient**: Assumes organic reach + small ad budget works (Lines 189, 278)
- **Reward fulfillment costs covered in budget**: Assumes €3 seeds, €5 digital books, €8 trees covered (Lines 140-169)
- **Germany-based crowdfunding better than international**: Assumes local audience preference (Lines 100-120)

## Top 3 Questions for User

1. **CRITICAL CONTRADICTION**: How can you register a gGmbH (requiring €40k: €25k capital + €15k setup) when you're still raising the first €20-30k for operations? Does the €20-30k budget INCLUDE or EXCLUDE the gGmbH costs? (This contradicts File 10 assumptions)

2. **Personal Capital**: Do you actually have €5-10k in liquid savings available to invest, and have you identified 10-20 specific people in your network who can contribute €250-1,000 each (totaling €5-10k from friends/family)?

3. **Timing & Capacity**: Are you working on this full-time or part-time? Managing 5 parallel fundraising streams while planning operations is 60-80 hours/week of work - is this realistic with your current situation?

## Cross-File Contradictions & Dependencies

**CRITICAL**: This file assumes tax-deductible donations via gGmbH but doesn't account for the €40k required to register the gGmbH (€25k share capital + €15k setup costs mentioned in File 10). This creates a circular dependency:

- Can't register gGmbH without €40k
- Can't offer tax-deductible donations without gGmbH
- Can't raise €20-30k easily without tax-deductible option
- Can't get €40k for gGmbH if still raising first €20-30k

**Recommendation**: Either (A) clarify that founders already have €40k for gGmbH separate from €20-30k operating budget, or (B) switch to e.V. registration (€500) for Year 1, defer gGmbH to Year 2-3.

**Analysis Complete**: 8 critical assumptions, 6 high priority, 7 medium priority. Major contradiction with gGmbH funding timeline needs immediate resolution.
