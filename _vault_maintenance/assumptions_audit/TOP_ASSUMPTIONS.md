## 🚨 TIER 1: CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS (Blocking Issues)

### A1. Budget Source Availability

**Assumption**: €20,000-€30,000 will be available from combination of crowdfunding (€8-15k), friends/family (€5-10k), grants (€3-8k), and founder savings (€5-10k).

**Source Files**: 01, 03, 04, 11, 12, 30, 32
**Agent Analysis**: Agents 1, 3, 4, 11, 12

**Current State**:
- ❌ No crowdfunding campaign launched or audience built
- ❌ No documented conversations with friends/family
- ❌ No specific grants identified or applications submitted
- ❌ No confirmation of founder savings amount

**Alternatives**:
1. **Founder has €20-30k in savings NOW** (start immediately, no external fundraising needed)
2. **Secure one major grant first** (€20-30k) then launch operations (6-12 month delay)
3. **Ultra-lean start** with only €10-15k confirmed (reduce scope: 0.5ha, lease not buy, minimal tech)
4. **Part-time approach** while maintaining employment (6-12 month longer timeline)

**Uncertainty**: HIGH (no funding source confirmed)
**Impact**: CRITICAL (project cannot start without funding)
**Evidence**: NONE (all sources are planned/hoped for, not secured)
**Priority**: TIER 1 - Must validate BEFORE any other planning

---

### A2. Legal Entity Cost Reality

**Assumption**: gGmbH (gemeinnützige GmbH) is the appropriate legal structure and costs €1-3k to establish.

**Source Files**: 10, 11, 13, 30, 32
**Agent Analysis**: Agents 5, 6, 8, 11, 12

**MAJOR CONTRADICTION FOUND**:
- **File 30** (Business Model): "Formation Costs: €1,000-3,000"
- **File 10** (Org Structure): €25,000 share capital + €15,000 setup = **€40,000 total**
- **File 13** (Legal Framework): "Total: €28,450-32,750" confirms €30-40k range

**Reality Check**:
- German law REQUIRES €25,000 minimum share capital for GmbH (cannot be avoided)
- Setup costs (notary, legal, registration) typically €5-15,000
- **ACTUAL COST**: €30,000-€40,000 minimum

**Alternative: e.V. (Registered Association)**:
- Setup cost: €500-€1,000
- No share capital requirement
- Same tax-exempt status available
- Same ability to receive donations, apply for grants
- **Cost savings**: €39,500 (98.75% reduction)

**Uncertainty**: LOW (legal requirements are clear, costs are documented)
**Impact**: CRITICAL (€40k vs €500 determines if project can legally incorporate)
**Evidence**: STRONG (German law is explicit)
**Priority**: TIER 1 - Fundamental decision before any fundraising

**Key Question**: Why spend €40k on gGmbH when e.V. costs €500 and can do the same work?

---

### A3. Geographic Location Clarity

**Assumption**: Project location is definitively decided and all planning aligns with that location.

**Source Files**: 02, 05, 07, 09, 10, 12, 15, 20, 21
**Agent Analysis**: Agents 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 15

**FUNDAMENTAL CONTRADICTION**:

**Documents indicating GERMANY**:
- File 12 (Team Roles): "Primary office: Bonn, Germany"
- File 12 (Team Roles): "Field site: Germany (temperate climate zone)"
- File 15 (Site Selection): "Within Germany (simplifies legal/regulatory)"
- File 20 (Restoration Methodology): German species (Oak, Beech, Birch), German rainfall data
- File 21 (Technology): "Germany average rainfall: 700-800 mm/year"

**Documents indicating PORTUGAL/SOUTHERN EUROPE**:
- File 02 (Project Vision): "Initial Target: Portugal or Southern Spain"
- File 02 (Project Vision): Lists 5 Southern European countries as targets
- Various references to "Southern Europe" focus

**Why This Matters Enormously**:

| Factor | Germany (Temperate) | Portugal (Mediterranean) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **Climate** | 4 seasons, 700-800mm rain | Summer drought, 400-600mm rain |
| **Native Species** | Oak, Beech, Birch | Cork Oak, Holm Oak, Mediterranean Pine |
| **Restoration Approach** | Temperate forest regeneration | Dryland/drought-adapted restoration |
| **Land Costs** | €15-30k per hectare | €5-15k per hectare |
| **Living Costs** | €15-30k/person/year | €10-18k/person/year |
| **Legal Structure** | German gGmbH (€40k) | Portuguese IPSS/Associação (€500-2k) |
| **Solar Production** | 3-4 hours winter sun | 5-6 hours winter sun |
| **Water Strategy** | Rainwater + delivery | MUST have well or delivery costs explode |

**Uncertainty**: HIGH (contradictory information across documents)
**Impact**: CRITICAL (entire methodology, species, budget, legal structure is wrong if location unclear)
**Evidence**: CONFLICTING (different files say different things)
**Priority**: TIER 1 - Must resolve IMMEDIATELY before any planning

---

### A4. Founder Team Capacity

**Assumption**: 1-2 founders possess sufficient skills, time, and energy to execute all Year 1 tasks simultaneously.

**Source Files**: 01, 03, 04, 12, 14, 18, 42, 43
**Agent Analysis**: Agents 1, 3, 4, 7, 14, 18

**Year 1 Workload Breakdown**:

**Daily Operations** (File 43):
- 7:00-12:00 PM: Physical labor (planting, clearing, building) - 5 hours
- 12:00-2:00 PM: Lunch + rest - 2 hours
- 2:00-5:00 PM: Lighter work (maintenance, planning) - 3 hours
- 5:00-7:00 PM: Admin, communications, documentation - 2 hours
- **TOTAL**: 10-12 hours/day, 6 days/week = **60-72 hours/week**

**Marketing/Communications** (File 60):
- 2-3 social media posts per week

- ✅ Electrical/solar installation
- ✅ Plumbing/water systems
- ✅ Accounting/bookkeeping
- ✅ Grant writing
- ✅ Social media/marketing
- ✅ Photography/videography
- ✅ Community organizing
- ✅ Scientific documentation

**Reality Check**: This is 2-3 full-time jobs compressed into 1-2 people.

**Uncertainty**: HIGH (no skills assessment documented, no time-motion study)
**Impact**: CRITICAL (burnout, incomplete work, or project failure)
**Evidence**: NONE (assumption not validated against founder reality)
**Priority**: TIER 1 - Must honestly assess before starting

---

### A5. Founder Financial Survival

**Assumption**: Founders can survive 12+ months on €0-€5,000 total compensation while working full-time.

**Source Files**: 12, 14, 42, 43
**Agent Analysis**: Agents 7, 14

**The Math**:
- **Project compensation**: €0-€5,000 total Year 1 (for 1-2 people)
- **Minimum living expenses in Germany** (per person):
  - Rent: €4,800-9,600 (€400-800/month)
  - Food: €2,400-3,600
  - Health insurance (mandatory): €2,400-4,800
  - Transport: €600-1,200
  - Phone/internet: €300-600
  - Misc: €600-1,200
  - **TOTAL: €11,100-€21,000 per person**

**For 2 founders**: €22,200-€42,000 living expenses not covered by project

**Three Scenarios**:
1. **Founders have €15-25k savings EACH** → Can bootstrap full-time
2. **Founders work part-time jobs** → Only 15-20 hr/week on project (timeline doubles)
3. **Founders live with family/parents** → Free housing reduces need to €6-12k/person

**Uncertainty**: HIGH (no documentation of founder financial situation)
**Impact**: CRITICAL (project fails if founders run out of money or must take jobs)
**Evidence**: NONE (assumption not validated)
**Priority**: TIER 1 - Must clarify BEFORE committing to timeline

---

## 🔴 TIER 2: HIGH-PRIORITY ASSUMPTIONS (Answer within 1-2 weeks)

### A6. Timeline Feasibility (90 Days to Launch)

**Assumption**: Project can go from planning to on-site operations in 90 days.

**Source Files**: 04, 08, 14, 42
**Agent Analysis**: Agents 4, 8, 14

**90-Day Plan** (File 42):
- **Days 1-30**: Crowdfunding prep + land search begins
- **Days 31-60**: Campaign runs + F&F fundraising + site visits
- **Days 61-90**: Land closing + equipment orders + move prep

**What Could Delay**:
1. **Crowdfunding**: Needs 300-500 email list (takes 3-6 months to build from zero)
2. **Land acquisition**: German notary (2-4 weeks wait) + Grundbuch registration (4-8 weeks) = 6-12 weeks minimum
3. **Equipment**: Solar systems (4-8 week delivery), tiny house (variable)
4. **Bureaucracy**: Permits, approvals, inspections (unpredictable)

**More Realistic Timeline**: 120-180 days (4-6 months)

**Uncertainty**: MEDIUM-HIGH (timeline assumes smooth execution)
**Impact**: HIGH (delays cascade through entire project)
**Evidence**: WEAK (optimistic scenario only, no buffer for delays)
**Priority**: TIER 2 - Plan with contingency buffer

---

### A7. Land Price Accuracy

**Assumption**: Suitable 1-hectare land available for €5,000-€25,000 in target regions.

**Source Files**: 04, 15, 16, 30, 44
**Agent Analysis**: Agents 4, 15, 16

**Stated Price Ranges**:
- File 44: "€8,000-25,000 for 1 hectare at €8-25/m²"
- File 30: "€5k-€15k budget range (or affordable lease)"

**Validation Question**: Have you ACTUALLY browsed listings?
- Immobilienscout24.de (Germany)
- Idealista.pt (Portugal)
- Filter: 0.5-2 hectares, €5-30k

**Price Reality Check** (rough estimates):
- **Rural Brandenburg/Saxony (Germany)**: €10-30k per hectare
- **Rural Portugal (Alentejo)**: €3-12k per hectare
- **Near cities/accessible areas**: 2-3x higher

**Uncertainty**: MEDIUM (needs market validation)
**Impact**: HIGH (budget insufficient if real prices higher)
**Evidence**: WEAK (estimates, not confirmed market data)
**Priority**: TIER 2 - Validate within 1 week (2-3 hours of research)

---

### A8. Tiny House Legality on Agricultural Land

**Assumption**: Tiny house can be legally placed on agricultural/forest land for permanent residence.

**Source Files**: 15, 44
**Agent Analysis**: Agent 15

**German Reality**:
- Building regulations vary by **municipality** (not federal)
- Many areas PROHIBIT permanent housing on agricultural land
- "Agricultural worker housing" requires commercial agriculture proof
- Caravans/RVs sometimes allowed as "temporary" (enforcement varies)

**What This Means**:
- ✅ BEST CASE: Bauamt allows tiny house as agricultural worker housing
- ⚠️ GRAY AREA: Caravan allowed as "temporary" but not permanent
- ❌ WORST CASE: No on-site housing allowed → must rent nearby (€5-10k/year cost)

**Action Required**: Call Bauamt in 2-3 target municipalities (30 min total)

**Uncertainty**: HIGH (no validation with authorities)
**Impact**: HIGH (housing costs €5-10k/year if not allowed, or daily commute)
**Evidence**: NONE (legal assumption not checked)
**Priority**: TIER 2 - Validate before site selection finalizes

---

### A9. Crowdfunding Success Probability

**Assumption**: First-time crowdfunding campaign can raise €8,000-€15,000 for environmental restoration.

**Source Files**: 11, 12, 30, 32, 60
**Agent Analysis**: Agents 11, 12, 18

**Success Factors** (from research):
- 30-50% of goal PRE-COMMITTED by close network before launch
- 300-500 email subscribers before launch
- Professional 3-5 minute video
- Active social following (500+ engaged)
- 4-8 weeks of pre-launch marketing

**Current State**:
- ❌ No email list
- ❌ No social following
- ❌ No video created
- ❌ No pre-commitments

**Industry Reality**:
- Environmental restoration success rate: 20-35% of campaigns reach goal
- Average time to prepare: 3-6 months (not 4 weeks as in 90-day plan)
- Campaigns without pre-existing audience: <15% success rate

**Uncertainty**: HIGH (assumes audience building happens quickly)
**Impact**: HIGH (€8-15k funding gap if campaign fails, plus €2-5k wasted on campaign costs)
**Evidence**: WEAK (no validation of audience or interest)
**Priority**: TIER 2 - Test messaging/interest before investing in full campaign

---

### A10. Friends & Family Funding Availability

**Assumption**: Friends and family will contribute €5,000-€10,000 to the project.

**Source Files**: 11, 12, 30, 32
**Agent Analysis**: Agents 11, 12

**What This Requires**:
- 5-10 people contributing €1,000-€2,000 each, OR
- 10-20 people contributing €250-€500 each, OR
- 2-3 people contributing €3,000-€5,000 each

**Reality Check Questions**:
1. Do you KNOW 10-20 people with disposable income of €250-2,000?
2. Have you HAD conversations asking if they'd support this?
3. Any verbal commitments or soft "yes" responses?

**Most Likely Scenario**: €2,000-€4,000 actual (not €5-10k assumed)
- Close family: 2-3 people × €500-1,000 = €1,000-3,000
- Friends: 5-10 people × €50-200 = €250-2,000
- **Total: €1,250-€5,000** (not the assumed €5-10k)

**Uncertainty**: HIGH (no documented conversations)
**Impact**: HIGH (€3-7k funding gap)
**Evidence**: NONE (assumption not tested)
**Priority**: TIER 2 - Have 10-20 conversations in next 2 weeks

---

## ⚠️ TIER 3: MEDIUM-PRIORITY ASSUMPTIONS (Answer within 2-4 weeks)

### A11. Small Grants Accessibility (€3-8k Year 1)

**Assumption**: Can secure €3,000-€8,000 from small grants in Year 1.

**Source Files**: 11, 12, 30, 32
**Agent Analysis**: Agents 11, 12

**Reality Check**:
- Grant cycles: 6-12 months from application to funding
- Many require legal entity FIRST (gGmbH/e.V.) - catch-22!
- Success rate for first-time applicants: 10-20% (not 20-30% assumed)
- Application time: 2-4 weeks each × 10-15 applications = 20-60 weeks of work

**Most Likely Scenario**: €1,000-€3,000 in Year 1 (not €3-8k)
- Success: 2-3 small grants out of 10-15 applications
- Timeline: Funding arrives Month 9-12 (not Month 1-6)

**Uncertainty**: MEDIUM (grants exist but timeline/eligibility unclear)
**Impact**: MEDIUM (€2-5k shortfall, but other sources may compensate)
**Evidence**: WEAK (no specific grants identified)
**Priority**: TIER 3 - Start researching grants now for Year 2 funding

---

### A12. Volunteer Recruitment Feasibility

**Source Files**: 09, 14, 20, 43
**Agent Analysis**: Agents 9, 14

**What This Requires**:
- Existing network of 30-60 environmentally motivated people, OR
- Strong community presence attracting strangers, OR
- Partnership with environmental groups (NABU, BUND, universities)

**Reality for Year 1** (unknown project):
- Event 1: 5-8 people (mostly close friends/family)
- Event 2: 8-12 people (word of mouth + social media)
- Event 3: 10-15 people (if first two successful)
- **Total: 23-35 people, not 30-60**

**Impact on Planting Targets**:
- Planned: 100-200 trees (assumes 200-400 volunteer hours)
- Reality: 50-100 trees with 100-200 volunteer hours + founders

**Uncertainty**: MEDIUM (depends on founder network and outreach)
**Impact**: MEDIUM (targets reduced but not fatal)
**Evidence**: WEAK (volunteer interest not tested)
**Priority**: TIER 3 - Host 1 test event to gauge interest

---

### A13. Tree Survival Rate (70-85%)

**Assumption**: Planted trees will achieve 70-85% survival rate after 1 year.

**Source Files**: 03, 09, 14, 17, 20, 43
**Agent Analysis**: Agents 3, 9, 14, 17

**Variables Affecting Survival**:
- Species selection (native vs non-native)
- Site conditions (soil, water, sun)
- Planting technique (proper depth, mulching)
- Establishment care (watering frequency)
- Climate (drought, frost, heat stress)
- Deer/animal browse pressure
- Disease/pest pressure

**Realistic Estimates**:
- **Best case**: 80-90% (optimal conditions, experienced planters, good care)
- **Typical**: 60-75% (good effort, some learning curve)
- **Challenging**: 40-60% (difficult site, limited water, first-time planters)

**Uncertainty**: MEDIUM-HIGH (highly site and skill dependent)
**Impact**: MEDIUM (need to plant 2x if survival is 40-50% instead of 80%)
**Evidence**: WEAK (not validated for specific site/species/team)
**Priority**: TIER 3 - Plan for range (50-80%) rather than assuming 85%

---

- Scientific credibility and validation
- Research expertise and methodology
- Potential small fees (€1-3k/year)

**What Universities Need**:
- Research-worthy site (1ha may be too small for many studies)
- Data collection infrastructure (monitoring already in place)
- Publication potential (unique methodology or findings)
- Student project opportunities (accessible location)

**Reality Check**: Have you contacted ANY universities yet?
- ❌ No: This is entirely aspirational
- ✅ Yes: What was response?

**Uncertainty**: MEDIUM (universities often partner, but not guaranteed)
**Impact**: MEDIUM (credibility and monitoring costs affected)
**Evidence**: NONE (no outreach documented)
**Priority**: TIER 3 - Contact 3-5 universities in next 4 weeks

---

### A15. Water Strategy (Rainwater + Delivery vs Well)

**Assumption**: Rainwater harvesting + emergency delivery is better than drilling a well.

**Source Files**: 10, 21
**Agent Analysis**: Agent 10

**The Comparison**:

| Strategy | Upfront Cost | Annual Cost | 10-Year Cost |
|----------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Rainwater + Delivery** | €600-1,000 | €1,000-3,000 | €10,600-31,000 |
| **Well Drilling** | €3,000-8,000 | €100-300 | €4,000-11,000 |

**File 21 Analysis**:
- Rainwater covers only 20-30% of needs (based on 700mm Germany rain)
- Gap requires €1-3k/year in delivery costs
- Over 5-10 years, well is CHEAPER than ongoing delivery

**But**: Well requires €3-8k upfront that bootstrap budget may not have.

**Uncertainty**: LOW (math is clear, but budget availability unclear)
**Impact**: MEDIUM (ongoing costs vs upfront investment trade-off)
**Evidence**: MODERATE (lifecycle costs calculated)
**Priority**: TIER 3 - Depends on upfront budget availability

- Quarterly: Comprehensive progress report
- Ad hoc: Press releases, media outreach, partnership development

**Time Required**:
- Social media: 3-5 hours/week
- Newsletter: 2-4 hours/month
- Video updates: 4-8 hours/month
- Blog posts: 3-5 hours/month
- Reports: 8-12 hours/quarter
- **TOTAL: ~10-15 hours/week just for marketing**

**Reality**: If founders work 60 hr/week total, 10-15 hr on marketing = only 45-50 hr for operations.

**Alternative**: Minimal marketing Year 1 (one platform only, monthly not weekly)

**Uncertainty**: LOW (time requirements are clear)
**Impact**: MEDIUM (marketing neglected OR operations suffer)
**Evidence**: STRONG (workload math is straightforward)
**Priority**: TIER 3 - Scale down marketing plan for Year 1

---

### A17. Revenue Stream Viability (Eco-Tourism, Carbon, Energy)

**Assumption**: Three revenue streams (eco-tourism, carbon credits, energy sales) will generate €175k/year by Year 5.

**Source Files**: 11, 13, 30, 40
**Agent Analysis**: Agents 11, 13

**Year 5 Targets**:
- Eco-tourism: €75,000/year
- Carbon credits: €62,500/year
- Energy sales: €37,500/year
- **TOTAL: €175,000/year**

**Reality Check Questions**:

**Eco-Tourism**:
- €75k/year = 250 visitors × €300 average, OR 750 visitors × €100
- On 5-10 hectare site in restoration (not mature forest)
- Have you researched local eco-tourism demand? Pricing? Competition?

**Carbon Credits**:
- €62.5k = ~1,250 tons CO₂ × €50/ton (but price range is €5-80/ton)
- Verification takes 2-5 years (not available Year 2-3)
- Costs €5-15k upfront for third-party verification
- Is 5-10ha site too small for viable carbon project?

**Energy Sales**:
- €37.5k from solar surplus to grid
- What are German/Portuguese grid connection costs? Regulations? Pricing?
- Is surplus generation realistic with on-site consumption?

**Uncertainty**: HIGH (no market validation for any stream)
**Impact**: HIGH (financial sustainability fails if revenues don't materialize)
**Evidence**: NONE (all theoretical)
**Priority**: TIER 3 - Research ONE stream deeply before assuming all three work

---

### A18. Measurement & Monitoring Budget

**Assumption**: Scientific monitoring and KPI tracking can be done within bootstrap budget.

**Source Files**: 17, 51
**Agent Analysis**: Agent 17

**File 51 KPIs Include**:
- 50+ quantitative metrics
- Complex scientific measurements (microbial biomass, functional diversity indices)
- Third-party verification (carbon, soil, audits)

**Estimated Costs**:
- Soil testing (full panel): €300-800/test
- Water testing: €150-400/test
- Microbial analysis: €500-1,500 (lab work)
- Carbon verification: €5,000-15,000 (third-party)
- Annual audit: €3,000-5,000
- **TOTAL: €10,000-€25,000/year for full monitoring**

**Budget Reality**: If Year 1 total is €20-30k, cannot afford €10-25k/year on monitoring.

**Alternative**: Year 1 focus on simple observable metrics only (tree count, survival, photos, basic species list). Defer complex monitoring to Year 2-3.

**Uncertainty**: LOW (costs are clear)
**Impact**: MEDIUM (credibility affected, but can be phased)
**Evidence**: STRONG (professional monitoring is expensive)
**Priority**: TIER 3 - Create phased monitoring plan
