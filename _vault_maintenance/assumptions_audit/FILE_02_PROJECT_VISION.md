## Executive Summary

File 02 contains 10 major assumptions across geographic targeting, climate urgency, and model transferability. The most critical issue is **geographic vagueness** - "Portugal or Southern Spain" lacks specificity needed for actionable planning. The "critical decade" urgency claim needs validation. Assumption that successful restoration models from other continents will transfer to Mediterranean climate is HIGH risk.

---

## Critical Assumptions (Priority: CRITICAL)

### 1. Geographic Specificity - WHERE Exactly?

**Quote**: "Initial Target: Portugal or Southern Spain" (line 169)
**Location**: Section "Target Geography"
**Type**: Geographic

**Assumption**: The project can remain geographically vague ("Portugal OR Southern Spain") during Year 1 planning without deciding on a specific country/region.

**Alternatives**:
- Current: Keep options open - "Portugal or Southern Spain"
- Option B: Choose Portugal specifically (based on where founder lives?)
- Option C: Choose Southern Spain specifically (Andalusia, Extremadura?)
- Option D: Choose both as parallel pilot sites (requires 2x budget)

**Critical Question**: Which country do you live in NOW? This should drive the initial site selection, as bootstrapping requires hands-on presence.

**Impact if Wrong**: Cannot develop concrete site selection criteria, legal framework (gGmbH in Germany vs Portuguese/Spanish entity?), community partnerships, or regulatory compliance plans without knowing the country. All planning remains theoretical.

**Uncertainty**: HIGH - No indication of decision criteria or timeline for choosing

---

### 2. Climate Urgency - "Critical Decade" Validation

**Quote**: "We are in a critical decade for climate action" (line 248)
**Location**: Section "The Urgency"
**Type**: Timeline / Scientific Claim

**Assumption**: The "critical decade" framing is scientifically validated and creates genuine urgency for immediate action (vs. more measured 20-30 year restoration timeline).

**Alternatives**:
- Current: Frame as urgent "critical decade" - start NOW
- Option B: Frame as long-term 20-30 year restoration journey - start when ready
- Option C: Frame as "optimal window" rather than "critical" - balance urgency with preparation

**Critical Question**: What specific scientific sources validate that 2025-2035 is uniquely critical for Mediterranean restoration? Is this IPCC-backed or assumed?

**Impact if Wrong**: Creates artificial pressure to launch before adequate preparation, potentially leading to underfunded or poorly planned pilot that damages credibility and wastes resources.

**Uncertainty**: MEDIUM - General climate urgency is real, but "decade" specificity may be marketing language vs. hard science

---

### 3. Five-Country Target - Feasibility vs. Focus

**Quote**: "Countries needing urgent intervention: Portugal, Spain, Southern France, Greece, Italy" (lines 47-52)
**Location**: Section "Southern Europe: A Critical Battleground"
**Type**: Geographic / Strategic

**Assumption**: Listing five countries as targets is helpful/appropriate for a bootstrap project with 1-2 founders and €20-30k budget.

**Alternatives**:
- Current: Keep all five countries listed as potential targets
- Option B: Narrow to ONE country for Year 1-2, expand to others in Phase 2-3
- Option C: Choose TWO adjacent regions (e.g., Portugal + Andalusia) for comparison

**Critical Question**: For a bootstrap operation, shouldn't you choose ONE specific country/region first, rather than listing five? How does this multi-country framing help decision-making?

**Impact if Wrong**: Dilutes focus, creates analysis paralysis in site selection, makes regulatory/legal planning impossible (which country's laws?), complicates community engagement.

**Uncertainty**: HIGH - Appears to be aspirational framing vs. practical Year 1 planning

---

## High Priority Assumptions (Priority: HIGH)

### 4. Model Transferability - Global to Mediterranean

**Quote**: "Inspiration: Proven Global Models" - listing Loess Plateau (China), Great Green Wall (Africa), Atlantic Forest (Brazil), Gorongosa (Mozambique), Skjern River (Denmark)
**Location**: Lines 108-138
**Type**: Methodological / Geographic

**Assumption**: Restoration techniques proven in vastly different climates (Chinese loess plateau, African Sahel, Brazilian rainforest) will transfer effectively to Mediterranean semi-arid ecosystems.

**Critical Question**: Which of these models is MOST similar to Mediterranean conditions? Denmark's Skjern River is European but marshland (not semi-arid). Are there successful Mediterranean restoration cases?

**Impact if Wrong**: Methodology may fail due to climate/soil differences, wasting Year 1 budget and time learning what doesn't work.

**Uncertainty**: MEDIUM - Some transferability likely, but Mediterranean has unique characteristics (fire regime, summer drought)

---

### 5. Funding Availability - €20-30k Bootstrap

**Quote**: "€20k-€30k self/friends/family funding" (line 195)
**Location**: Section "3-Phase Growth Strategy" - Phase 1
**Type**: Financial

**Assumption**: The founder(s) have access to €20-30k through personal savings, friends, or family to bootstrap Year 1.

**Critical Question**: Do you personally have €20-30k available? Or is this an assumption that you'll need to fundraise from friends/family? What's the backup if this isn't available?

**Impact if Wrong**: Project cannot start as planned. Need to revise to "ultra-bootstrap" with <€10k or delay until funding secured.

**Uncertainty**: HIGH - No indication in docs whether this capital is secured or aspirational

---

### 6. Community Receptivity

**Quote**: "Community acceptance" listed as site selection criteria (line 161) and "Local people are partners, not recipients" (line 229)
**Location**: Multiple sections
**Type**: Social / Community

**Assumption**: Local communities in target regions will welcome and partner with an outside organization (potentially foreign founders) implementing restoration projects.

**Critical Question**: Have you tested community receptivity in any target region? What if communities are skeptical of "outsiders" coming to "restore" their land?

**Impact if Wrong**: Community resistance could block land access, create social friction, damage reputation, prevent scaling.

**Uncertainty**: MEDIUM - Depends heavily on approach, but community skepticism of external projects is common

---

### 7. Mediterranean Climate Restoration Potential

**Quote**: "Degraded land with restoration potential" and "High biodiversity restoration potential" (lines 149, 152)
**Location**: Section "Site Selection Criteria"
**Type**: Environmental / Scientific

**Assumption**: Degraded Mediterranean lands have sufficient restoration potential to achieve meaningful ecosystem recovery within 3-5 year timeframes.

**Critical Question**: What's the scientific evidence for Mediterranean ecosystem restoration timelines? Is 5 years realistic for visible results, or does it take 10-20 years?

**Impact if Wrong**: Pilot site shows minimal visible progress in Year 1-2, making investor fundraising difficult, damaging credibility.

**Uncertainty**: MEDIUM - Mediterranean ecosystems are slow-growing; restoration may take longer than temperate zones

---

### 8. Water Access for Establishment

**Quote**: "Water access for establishment phase" (line 151)
**Location**: Section "Site Selection Criteria - Environmental"
**Type**: Technical / Resource

**Assumption**: Suitable pilot sites will have adequate water access for establishing plantings, despite being in water-scarce semi-arid regions.

**Critical Question**: What level of water access is needed? Well? Irrigation system? Rainwater only? This has major cost implications.

**Impact if Wrong**: Plants die during establishment, pilot fails. Or, water infrastructure costs far exceed €20-30k budget.

**Uncertainty**: MEDIUM - Mediterranean summer drought is severe; establishment phase is critical

---

## Medium Priority Assumptions (Priority: MEDIUM)

### 9. Three-Phase Scaling Feasibility

**Assumption**: Growth from 1ha → 5-10ha → 50+ha is realistic and sequential
**Quote**: Lines 189-213 (3-Phase Growth Strategy section)
**Question**: Is expansion on the SAME site, or acquiring new sites? Document says "expansion potential to 5-10 hectares" (line 187) suggesting same site.

**Impact**: If same-site expansion isn't possible (land unavailable, ownership issues), need new site acquisition strategy.

---

### 10. Timeline Realism - 12-18 Months Phase 1

**Assumption**: Phase 1 can be completed in 12-18 months
**Quote**: "Timeline: 12-18 months" (line 198)
**Question**: What defines "completion" of Phase 1? Visible ecosystem results, or just "site established"?

**Impact**: If ecosystem results take 3-5 years, "12-18 months" may only cover site acquisition and initial planting, not "proof of concept."

---

### 11. Proximity to Population Centers

**Assumption**: Sites should be near population centers for education/tourism
**Quote**: "Proximity to population centers (education/tourism)" (line 156)
**Question**: How close? Within 50km? 100km? This limits site options significantly.

**Impact**: May exclude best restoration sites if they're remote.

---

### 12. Regulatory Support Assumption

**Assumption**: Target countries have "regulatory support for restoration"
**Quote**: Line 157
**Question**: Has this been validated for Portugal/Spain? What specific regulations support restoration?

**Impact**: May encounter unexpected regulatory barriers.

---

### 13. Multiple Revenue Streams Viability

**Assumption**: Eco-tourism, carbon credits, and energy sales will generate revenue in Phase 2
**Quote**: Lines 99-103
**Question**: On 5-10ha, are these revenue streams realistic? Carbon credits require scale; eco-tourism requires facilities.

**Impact**: Phase 2 may not be financially sustainable as quickly as assumed.

## Top 3 Questions for User

### 1. 🎯 GEOGRAPHIC DECISION - Where do you live NOW?
**Context**: Document lists "Portugal or Southern Spain" but doesn't choose. For bootstrap Year 1, you need to pick ONE country where you can be physically present.

**Question**: Which country do you currently live in, or plan to live in for Year 1? This should drive the site selection, legal entity choice (Portuguese vs Spanish vs German gGmbH), and all regulatory planning.

**Why Critical**: Cannot do ANY concrete planning (legal, site selection, community engagement) without choosing a country first.

---

### 2. 💰 FUNDING SOURCE - Do you have €20-30k available?
**Context**: Phase 1 assumes "€20k-€30k self/friends/family funding"

**Question**: Is this money currently available (in savings), or is this an assumption that you'll raise it from friends/family? What's your backup plan if you can only access €10k or less?

**Why Critical**: The entire Phase 1 strategy depends on this capital being available. If not, need to redesign as "ultra-bootstrap" or delay until funding secured.

---

### 3. 🌍 MODEL TRANSFERABILITY - Which reference project is most similar?
**Context**: Document lists 5 global restoration projects (China, Africa, Brazil, Mozambique, Denmark) as inspiration, but none are Mediterranean semi-arid.

**Question**: Have you found successful restoration case studies specifically from Mediterranean climates (Portugal, Spain, Southern France, Greece, Italy)? Which model is MOST similar to your target conditions?

**Why Critical**: Mediterranean ecosystems have unique challenges (summer drought, fire regime, slow-growing species). Need region-specific evidence that restoration works on 1ha scale within 12-18 months.
