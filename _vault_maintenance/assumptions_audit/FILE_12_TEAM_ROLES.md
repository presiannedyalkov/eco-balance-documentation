## Executive Summary

The Team Roles document contains **critical assumptions about founder capacity, compensation viability, and location** that need immediate validation. Most concerning: the assumption that 1-2 founders can execute all roles on €0-€5k/year, and a **geographic contradiction** (Bonn/Germany vs Portugal/Southern Europe mentioned elsewhere). Found 10 major assumptions across team capacity, hiring, compensation, and scaling.

---

## Critical Assumptions (Priority: CRITICAL)

### 1. Founder Survival on Minimal Compensation

**Quote**: "Year 1 Bootstrap Team (1-2 people): [...] Minimal/no salaries (€0-€5k total)"
**Location**: Lines 24-28, also lines 97, 141, 184
**Type**: Financial/Team

**Assumption**: Founder(s) can survive for 12+ months on €0-€5,000 total compensation while working full-time.

**Alternatives**:
- Current: €0-€5k/year total for 1-2 founders
- Option B: Part-time project + part-time paid work elsewhere (€20k+ from other job)
- Option C: Living off savings/support (requires €15-25k available funds for living expenses)

**Critical Question**: How will founder(s) cover living expenses during Year 1? (Rent, food, health insurance in Germany = €15-30k minimum)

**Impact if Wrong**: Project cannot start or founders burn out/quit within 3-6 months due to financial stress.
**Uncertainty**: HIGH

---

### 2. Geographic Location Contradiction

**Quote**: "Primary office: Bonn, Germany" and "Field site: Germany (temperate climate zone)"
**Location**: Lines 355-356
**Type**: Geographic/Strategic

**Assumption**: Project will be based in Germany (Bonn office, German field site, temperate climate).

**Alternatives**:
- Current: Germany/Bonn base with temperate climate focus
- Option B: Portugal/Southern Europe as stated in other documents (02_Project_Vision.md)
- Option C: Dual presence (German legal entity, Portuguese operations)

**Critical Question**: **WHERE will the project actually operate?** This doc says Germany; other docs say Portugal/Southern Europe. Major contradiction!

**Impact if Wrong**: Entire staffing strategy, salary levels, expertise requirements (temperate vs Mediterranean), and operational plans are misaligned.
**Uncertainty**: HIGH (direct contradiction with other docs)

---

### 3. Founder Capacity - All Roles Simultaneously

**Quote**: "Founder(s) [...] All Roles Combined: Project leadership, Restoration work, Community engagement, Documentation, Fundraising prep"
**Location**: Lines 31-38
**Type**: Team/Capacity

**Assumption**: 1-2 people can effectively execute 5+ full-time equivalent roles simultaneously (leadership, restoration, community, documentation, fundraising).

**Alternatives**:
- Current: 1-2 founders do everything
- Option B: 1-2 founders + volunteers for specific tasks
- Option C: Part-time team (3-4 people part-time = 1.5-2 FTE) instead of 1-2 full-time

**Critical Question**: Do founder(s) have ALL required expertise: ecological restoration, project management, community organizing, fundraising, and documentation? If not, how will gaps be filled?

**Impact if Wrong**: Critical functions neglected (most likely: fundraising and professional documentation), project stalls, poor quality outputs.
**Uncertainty**: HIGH

---

### 4. Year 2 Funding Availability for Professional Hires

**Quote**: "Restoration Specialist recruitment (often first hire)" at "Month 12-15" with salary "€35,000-€45,000/year"
**Location**: Lines 181, 185, 235-236
**Type**: Financial/Timeline

**Assumption**: €120,000-€160,000 funding will be secured by Month 12 to hire 3-4 professional staff in Year 2.

**Alternatives**:
- Current: Professional team hired Month 12-18 (needs €120-160k secured)
- Option B: Extended bootstrap (Year 1-2 on minimal team) until funding secured
- Option C: Gradual hiring (1 person Year 2, more in Year 3) based on actual funding

**Critical Question**: What is the PLAN if €120-160k funding is NOT secured by Month 12? Continue bootstrap, pause, or shut down?

**Impact if Wrong**: Cannot hire professional team, founders continue under extreme workload, project quality suffers, or project fails.
**Uncertainty**: HIGH (funding is uncertain)

---

## High Priority Assumptions (Priority: HIGH)

### 5. Competitive Salary Levels in Germany

**Quote**: "€40,000-€50,000/year (professional market rate)" for Executive Director
**Location**: Line 98
**Type**: Financial/Team

**Assumption**: These salaries (€35-50k for senior roles) are competitive enough to attract qualified professionals in Germany.

**Reality Check**:
- Executive Director with 5+ years experience + fundraising track record: Market rate in Germany is typically €55-75k
- Restoration Specialist with Master's + 3 years experience: Market rate €40-55k
- These salaries are 20-30% below market

**Alternatives**:
- Current: €35-50k salaries
- Option B: Higher salaries (€50-70k) but smaller team
- Option C: Remote candidates from lower-cost regions, or early-career professionals

**Critical Question**: Will €35-50k salaries attract experienced professionals in Germany, or will you need to hire less experienced staff or remote candidates?

**Impact if Wrong**: Cannot attract qualified candidates; hiring takes longer (6+ months); settle for less experienced staff; higher turnover risk.
**Uncertainty**: MEDIUM-HIGH

---

### 6. Qualified Candidate Availability

**Quote**: Required qualifications include "5+ years experience", "Master's/PhD", "proven track record"
**Location**: Lines 111-123, 198-213
**Type**: Team/Talent

**Assumption**: Highly qualified professionals (5+ years, advanced degrees, proven results) will be available and interested in below-market salaries at a pre-seed stage organization.

**Alternatives**:
- Current: Target senior professionals at below-market rates
- Option B: Early-career professionals (2-3 years) with growth potential at appropriate salary levels
- Option C: Mix of experienced advisors (part-time) + early-career executors (full-time)

**Critical Question**: Are you willing to hire early-career professionals (2-3 years experience) instead of 5+ year veterans if senior talent is unavailable at these salary levels?

**Impact if Wrong**: Hiring process fails or takes 6-12 months; project timeline delayed; settle for mismatched candidates.
**Uncertainty**: MEDIUM

---

### 7. Advisory Board Recruitment

**Quote**: "5-7 Experts" who volunteer "~20 hours per year"
**Location**: Lines 384, 441-444
**Type**: Team/Volunteer

**Assumption**: 5-7 senior experts (professors, directors, specialists) will volunteer 20 hours/year for a pre-seed stage project.

**Alternatives**:
- Current: 5-7 volunteer advisors (~140 hours total/year)
- Option B: Smaller board (3-4 advisors) with deeper engagement
- Option C: Paid advisors at €2-5k/year for critical expertise

**Critical Question**: Do founder(s) have existing relationships with potential advisory board members, or will recruitment start from scratch?

**Impact if Wrong**: No advisory support during critical early stages; decisions made without expert input; credibility gap with funders.
**Uncertainty**: MEDIUM

---

### 8. Hiring Timeline - 3-4 Months Per Position

**Quote**: "Timeline: 3-4 months per position"
**Location**: Line 297
**Type**: Timeline/Process

**Assumption**: Each professional hire can be completed in 3-4 months (job posting → offer acceptance).

**Reality Check**: Realistic timeline for senior environmental sector roles is typically 4-6 months, especially for non-profits with limited brand recognition.

**Alternatives**:
- Current: 3-4 months assumed
- Option B: 5-6 months realistic timeline (especially for first hires)
- Option C: Rolling recruitment starting 6 months before target start date

**Critical Question**: When will recruitment ACTUALLY begin for Month 12-15 hires? (Should start Month 6-9, not Month 9-12)

**Impact if Wrong**: Hires delayed by 2-4 months; Year 2 expansion timeline pushed back; increased founder burnout during transition.
**Uncertainty**: MEDIUM

---

## Medium Priority Assumptions (Priority: MEDIUM)

### 9. Professional Development Budget Jump

**Assumption**: Professional development jumps from €0-1k (Year 1) to €15-20k (Year 2)
**Location**: Lines 365-371
**Question**: Is €15-20k/year realistic for a 3-4 person team in Year 2, or should it be €5-10k initially?

---

### 10. Volunteer Program Scale

**Assumption**: 50-100 volunteers engaged annually by Year 3
**Location**: Line 548
**Question**: What infrastructure/staff time is needed to manage 50-100 volunteers effectively? (Typically 0.5-1 FTE coordinator)

---

### 11. Team Scaling Speed

**Assumption**: Team can scale smoothly: 1-2 (Year 1) → 3-4 (Year 2) → 10-15 (Year 4-5)
**Location**: Lines 20, 45, 68
**Question**: Has organizational capacity for this growth speed been validated? (Management systems, culture, training infrastructure)

---

### 12. Budget Sustainability Ratio

**Assumption**: "70-80% of budget on staff sustainable"
**Location**: Line 484
**Question**: Is 70-80% staff cost sustainable for an operational restoration project with significant equipment/land/infrastructure needs?

---

## Top 3 Questions for User

1. **CRITICAL - Location Contradiction**: This document says "Bonn, Germany" and "temperate climate" but other docs say "Portugal/Southern Europe". WHERE will the project actually be based? This affects everything: salaries, staff qualifications, legal structure, climate expertise needed.

2. **CRITICAL - Founder Survival**: How will founder(s) survive financially during Year 1 on €0-€5k? Living expenses in Germany are €15-30k minimum. Do you have savings, family support, or part-time income planned?

3. **CRITICAL - Founder Skills**: Do the founder(s) currently possess expertise in ALL these areas: ecological restoration (hands-on), project management, community organizing, fundraising, and scientific documentation? If not, which skills exist and which need to be learned or supplemented?

## Geographic Assumption Conflict - REQUIRES IMMEDIATE CLARIFICATION

**This document states**:
- Primary office: Bonn, Germany (line 355)
- Field site: Germany (temperate climate zone) (line 356)
- Ecologist needs: "Temperate ecosystem restoration experience (Germany/Central Europe)" (line 209)
- Ecologist needs: "Four-season climate adaptation expertise" (line 210)
- Ecologist needs: "Native German species knowledge" (line 211)

**Other documents state**:
- 02_Project_Vision.md mentions Southern Europe focus
- Operations planned for Portugal (implied in various docs)

**Resolution needed**: The entire staffing strategy, salary benchmarks, required expertise, and operational planning depends on whether this is a **German temperate climate project** or a **Portuguese/Southern European Mediterranean climate project**.

**Impact**: If location is actually Portugal:
- Office location should be Portugal (not Bonn)
- Salaries may be different (Portugal = lower cost of living)
- Expertise needed: Mediterranean restoration (not temperate)
- Native species knowledge: Portuguese/Mediterranean flora (not German)
- Climate expertise: Mediterranean/drought adaptation (not four-season temperate)

This is a **FUNDAMENTAL contradiction** that must be resolved before any hiring or team planning can proceed.

## Additional Notes

### Founder Capacity Reality Check

The Year 1 workload breakdown implies:
- Project leadership & strategy: 15-20 hrs/week
- Hands-on restoration work: 20-25 hrs/week
- Community engagement: 5-10 hrs/week
- Documentation & reporting: 5-10 hrs/week
- Fundraising preparation: 10-15 hrs/week
- **TOTAL: 55-80 hours/week**

This is 1.5-2 FTE workload for 1-2 people. If 2 founders, this is feasible but intense. If 1 founder, this is unrealistic without cutting scope or quality in some areas.

### Year 2 Hiring Dependencies

The entire Year 2 professional team hiring plan depends on:
1. Securing €120-160k funding by Month 12 (**uncertain**)
2. Successful Year 1 proof-of-concept (**uncertain**)
3. Clear organizational structure established (**doable**)
4. Attractive employer value proposition despite below-market salaries (**uncertain**)

**Contingency planning needed**: What happens if funding is delayed by 6-12 months?
