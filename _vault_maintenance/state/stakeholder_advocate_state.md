## Notes

2. Foundation Officer Frederik - Reviews 100+ applications/year, wants measurable impact
3. Village Mayor Maria - Pragmatic elected official, wants local jobs and community benefit
4. Professor Paulo - University researcher, wants research opportunities and publications
5. Volunteer Viktor - Climate-conscious professional, wants tangible impact and community

**Key Success Indicator**: All external-facing documents should pass the "Would [Stakeholder] support/fund/join based on this?" test for their target audience.

**Integration with Other Personas**:
- Run after Curator (content quality) and before final Quality Inspector (polish)
- Coordinate with Strategic Advisor on stakeholder feasibility
- Collaborate with Security Auditor on appropriate disclosure levels per stakeholder
