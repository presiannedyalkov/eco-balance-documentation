## Next Analysis Plan

### Focus Areas
1. **Strategic Documents Scan** (Priority: CRITICAL)
   - Files 01-12 (Vision, Mission, Legal, Operations)
   - Files 20-22 (Methodology, Technology)
   - Files 30-32 (Business Model, Finance, Funding)
   - Files 40-42 (Team, Partners, Advisory)
   - Files 50-52 (Timeline, Milestones, Risks)
   - Files 60-62 (Marketing, Community, Impact)

2. **Sensitive Data Detection**
   - Email addresses scan
   - Phone numbers scan
   - Physical addresses scan
   - Financial information scan
   - Personal identification scan

3. **Document Classification**
   - Apply PUBLIC/INTERNAL/CONFIDENTIAL framework
   - Identify mixed-classification documents
   - Recommend redactions for public release

4. **Privacy Compliance Review**
   - GDPR compliance assessment
   - Privacy policy review
   - Data processing documentation check

5. **Public Launch Readiness**
   - GitHub repository safety audit
   - Website content security review
   - External communications verification

### Expected Deliverables
- Security audit report with findings
- Document classification list
- Redaction recommendations
- GDPR compliance status
- Publication readiness assessment
- Security task queue

### Priority Documents for First Scan
1. `01_Vision_Mission_Values.md` - Likely PUBLIC, verify no sensitive details
2. `32_Funding_Strategy.md` - High risk: financial details, partner info
3. `42_Partner_Strategy.md` - High risk: confidential partnerships
4. `12_Governance.md` - Medium risk: internal structures
5. `31_Financial_Projections.md` - High risk: financial specifics
6. `40_Team_Structure.md` - Medium risk: personal information
7. `60_Marketing_Communications.md` - Likely PUBLIC, verify messaging

## Notes

**Critical for Launch**: Before any public release (GitHub, website, social media), a complete security audit must be performed to prevent:
- Personal data exposure (GDPR violations)
- Financial information leaks
- Confidential partnership details disclosure
- Internal operational security risks
- Reputational damage from data breaches

**First Analysis Objectives**:
1. Establish security baseline
2. Identify critical redaction needs
3. Create classification inventory
4. Assess GDPR compliance status
5. Define publication-ready vs internal-only content

**Security Review Triggers**:
- Before GitHub repository publication
- Before website launch
- Before external presentations
- Before grant applications (ensure only appropriate data shared)
- Before partnership discussions (verify confidentiality)
- After significant document updates
- Quarterly security audits
