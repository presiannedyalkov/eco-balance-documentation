## Key Findings

### CHANGELOG Verification
✅ **Accurate**: Files 10-13 NOT listed in v2.0.0 CHANGELOG entry
- CHANGELOG correctly documents only 8 converted files (20, 21, 30, 32, 42, 43, 44, 45)
- Files 10-13 remain v1.0 Large-Scale content as expected
- No false claims of conversion

### Historical Preservation
✅ **No action needed**: Files not yet converted
- No v1.0 versions to archive at this time
- When conversion occurs, consider archiving original v1.0 organizational docs
- Archive structure ready for future preservation

### Archive Structure
✅ **Adequate**: Current structure can accommodate future needs
- archive/pre-v1.0.0/ for historical docs
- archive/_process_history/ for process docs
- Could add archive/v1.0.0-organizational-docs/ when conversion complete

## Recommendations

1. **Continue with Step 3** (Methodology & Business docs 20-32)
2. **After CRITICAL fixes**: Execute FIX-009 to FIX-011 to convert organizational docs

4. **No urgent issues**: All findings already tracked in FIX_TASKS.md
