## Executive Summary

Content quality and coherence audit completed. Overall content health is **GOOD** (82/100), improved from 78/100 since last analysis. Executive Summary v2.0 conversion completed successfully. Cross-references are mostly functional (cohesion audit fixes applied). Content is complete with no placeholder text detected. Minor gaps remain: some strategic documents may need v2.0 alignment verification, and cross-reference improvements could enhance discoverability. Narrative flow is strong, and coherence is good with adaptive framework language consistent.
