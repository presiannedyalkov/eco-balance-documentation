## Notes

- First analysis identified 8 status accuracy issues across strategic documents
- Main pattern: Present tense used for future goals/vision elements
- Three-layer framework (Vision, Reality, Planning) is well-implemented in Executive Summary
- Recent Scientific Grounding fix shows correct approach (future tense for vision)
- Need to extend this pattern to all vision/planning descriptions
