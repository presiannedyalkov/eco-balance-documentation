- 2025-11-09: **Implementation Coach persona created**
- 2025-11-09: Playbook templates created
- 2025-11-09: Initial playbooks directory structure established

### Active Issues

| **Overall Readiness** | 0/100 | 90/100 | ⏳ Not started |

### Improvement Path

**To reach 90/100:**
1. Create 3 critical playbooks (gGmbH, funding, land) → +25 points
2. Map all Year 1 dependencies → +20 points
3. Validate Bootstrap timeline with buffers → +18 points
4. Document resource requirements → +14 points
5. Identify and mitigate blockers → +13 points

## Next Analysis Plan

### Schedule

**Date**: 2025-11-16 (One week from creation)
**Type**: Initial execution readiness assessment
**Purpose**: Establish baseline and identify priority playbooks

### Focus Areas

1. **Assess Year 1 Bootstrap strategy** - Review documents 42, 43, 44, and related
2. **Identify playbook gaps** - Which critical processes lack detailed plans?
3. **Map dependencies** - What must happen before what?
4. **Validate timelines** - Is 6-month Bootstrap realistic?
5. **Identify blockers** - What could prevent execution?

### Expected State

**After first analysis:**
- Execution readiness baseline established
- 3-5 priority playbooks identified
- Critical dependencies mapped
- Timeline risks documented
- 5-10 tasks generated for playbook creation

**Initial playbook priorities:**
1. gGmbH Registration (CRITICAL - Month 1-3)
2. Bootstrap Funding Acquisition (CRITICAL - Month 1-6)
3. Land Acquisition Process (HIGH - Month 1-6)
4. Team Recruitment (HIGH - Month 1-3)
5. Community Engagement Launch (MEDIUM - Month 2-4)

## Playbook Inventory

### Existing Playbooks

**Created** (3):
1. `playbooks/ggmbh_registration_playbook.md` (Sample) - Week-by-week for gGmbH setup
2. `playbooks/bootstrap_funding_playbook.md` (Sample) - Week-by-week for €20-30k funding
3. `playbooks/land_acquisition_playbook.md` (Sample) - Week-by-week for 1-hectare site

**Status**: All three are initial samples - will need refinement based on actual research and strategic documents

### Planned Playbooks

**High Priority** (Month 1-6):
- Team Recruitment Playbook
- Community Engagement Launch Playbook
- Partnership Development Playbook
- Website & Social Media Launch Playbook
- First Planting Season Playbook
- Volunteer Program Setup Playbook

**Medium Priority** (Month 6-12):
- Infrastructure Development Playbook
- Monitoring System Setup Playbook
- Educational Program Launch Playbook
- First Grant Application Playbook

**Low Priority** (Year 2+):

## Dependency Map Status

### Critical Path (Month 1-6)

**Not yet mapped** - Awaiting first analysis

Expected critical path:
1. gGmbH Registration → Bank Account → Funding Capability
2. Bootstrap Funding → Resource Availability → Land Acquisition
3. Land Acquisition → Site Access → Restoration Activities
4. Team Formation → Execution Capacity → All Activities

### External Dependencies

**Not yet identified** - Awaiting first analysis

Expected external dependencies:
- Government agencies (gGmbH registration, permits)
- Legal professionals (organizational setup)
- Funders/donors (capital acquisition)
- Property owners/agents (land access)
- Community stakeholders (social license)

---

## Timeline Validation Status

### Bootstrap Timeline (Month 1-6)

**Not yet validated** - Awaiting first analysis

**Key Questions:**
- Is 6 months realistic for gGmbH + funding + land + team + first activities?
- What buffers exist for delays?
- What seasonal constraints affect timeline?
- What external dependencies could cause delays?
- What's the critical path duration?

### Validation Approach

1. Research actual gGmbH registration timelines in Portugal
2. Interview or research land acquisition timelines
3. Review funding acquisition case studies
4. Build detailed week-by-week plan
5. Add minimum 20% buffer
6. Identify seasonal factors (planting seasons, holiday periods)
7. Reality-check against founder capacity

## Resource Requirements Status

### Time Requirements

**Not yet calculated** - Awaiting first analysis

Expected format:
- Total person-hours for Year 1 Bootstrap
- Breakdown by major activity
- Founder time vs volunteer time
- Expertise requirements

### Financial Requirements

**Referenced in strategic docs** - Need consolidation
- Bootstrap budget: €20-30k (documented in File 32)
- Need breakdown by category and timeline
- Need to map spending to execution milestones

### Expertise Gaps

**Not yet identified** - Awaiting first analysis

Expected gaps:
- Legal (gGmbH formation, land contracts)
- Restoration ecology (methodology design)
- Community engagement (stakeholder relations)
- Fundraising (grant writing, donor relations)

## Notes

### Execution Philosophy

The Implementation Coach focuses on **tactical realism over strategic optimism**. Every playbook should:
- Break goals into weekly actions
- Include realistic time estimates with buffers
- Identify dependencies and blockers
- Provide templates and checklists
- Include backup plans
- Define clear success criteria

### Integration with Strategic Documents

**Key Documents to Operationalize:**
- 42_Next_Steps_90_Days.md - Immediate action plan
- 43_Operations_Action_Plan.md - Operational framework
- 44_Site_Selection_Land_Acquisition.md - Land process
- 32_Funding_Strategy.md - Funding approach
- 30_Business_Model.md - Business operations
- 12_Organizational_Structure.md - gGmbH setup

### Quality Standards for Playbooks

Every playbook must include:
1. ✅ Clear goal and success criteria
2. ✅ Prerequisites and dependencies
3. ✅ Week-by-week breakdown
4. ✅ Resource requirements (time, money, expertise)
5. ✅ Decision points and options
6. ✅ Templates and checklists
7. ✅ Common pitfalls and solutions
8. ✅ Success metrics and validation
9. ✅ Next steps after completion
