5. **Review remaining task** - Is Task 002 ready to execute?

### Expected State

**Next analysis should show:**
- Root directory maintained at ~27 files (no regression)
- Process subdirectories in use
- Health score maintained at 85-90/100
- No new high-priority organizational issues
- Possible slight improvements if Task 002 completed

### Special Checks

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

**Planning:**
- Creating subdirectories BEFORE moving files (Task 003 → Task 001 sequence)
- Checking for cross-references before moving files
- Clear task documentation with verification criteria

**Execution:**
- Step-by-step approach (one task at a time)
- Verification after each major step
- Creating READMEs for all new subdirectories
- Updating main README with new structure

**Results:**
- Clean, organized vault
- No broken references
- Significant health score improvement
- Sustainable organizational structure

### Future Recommendations

**For Similar Cleanup Tasks:**
1. Always create directory structure before moving files
2. Always check for cross-references first
3. Always verify after each major operation
4. Document all new directories with READMEs
5. Update parent directory documentation

**For Vault Maintenance:**
1. Run Janitor analysis monthly (or after major changes)
2. Execute high-priority tasks immediately
3. Defer low-urgency tasks for batch processing
4. Keep root directory clean (only strategic docs + essential meta)
5. Ensure new files go to proper subdirectories
