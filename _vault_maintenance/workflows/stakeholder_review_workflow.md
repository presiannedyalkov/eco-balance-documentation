# Stakeholder Review Workflow

## Purpose

This workflow guides the process of conducting multi-perspective stakeholder reviews to ensure documentation resonates with all key audience groups. The Stakeholder Advocate uses this workflow to systematically assess messaging effectiveness and stakeholder alignment.

## When to Use This Workflow

### Triggers
- **Before public launch**: Review all external-facing documents
- **Before fundraising**: Review funding strategy and pitch materials from funder perspectives
- **Before partnerships**: Review collaboration proposals from partner perspectives
- **Before community engagement**: Review messaging from community leader perspectives
- **After major content updates**: Re-review documents that changed significantly
- **Quarterly strategic reviews**: Systematic review of key stakeholder-facing documents

### Document Types Requiring Stakeholder Review
- Funding strategies and investment proposals
- Community engagement and marketing communications
- Partnership and collaboration proposals
- Volunteer recruitment materials
- Public-facing strategic documents
- Website and social media content
- Grant applications
- Pitch decks and presentations

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Preparation (15-30 minutes)

#### 1.1 Identify Document and Purpose
- [ ] Select document for review
- [ ] Identify document's primary purpose (inform, persuade, engage, etc.)
- [ ] Determine target stakeholder audience(s)
- [ ] Review document's stated goals

#### 1.2 Select Relevant Stakeholder Personas
From the 5 core stakeholder personas, select those most relevant:
- [ ] **Impact Investor Isabel** - For funding, investment, financial documents
- [ ] **Foundation Officer Frederik** - For grant applications, foundation outreach
- [ ] **Village Mayor Maria** - For community engagement, local partnership materials
- [ ] **Professor Paulo** - For research partnerships, academic collaborations
- [ ] **Volunteer Viktor** - For volunteer recruitment, engagement materials

#### 1.3 Gather Context
- [ ] Read previous stakeholder reviews (if any)
- [ ] Review stakeholder feedback received (if any)
- [ ] Check state file for known stakeholder concerns
- [ ] Note any recent stakeholder interactions or engagement results

### Step 2: Multi-Perspective Review (60-90 minutes)

#### 2.1 Review from Each Stakeholder Perspective

For **each relevant stakeholder persona**, conduct a complete review:

**Step 2.1.1: Assume the Persona**
- Read the full stakeholder persona profile
- Adopt their motivations, concerns, and mindset
- Consider their context and constraints
- Remember what they value and what they fear

**Step 2.1.2: Read Document from Their Perspective**

Ask from this stakeholder's viewpoint:

**Value Clarity Questions**:
- What's in it for me?
- Why should I care about this?
- How does this benefit me or my mission?
- What problem does this solve for me?

**Trust & Credibility Questions**:
- Do I believe these people can deliver?
- What evidence supports their claims?
- What's their track record?
- Who else has validated this?

**Risk & Concern Questions**:
- What could go wrong for me?
- How is my risk mitigated?
- What happens if this fails?
- Are my specific concerns addressed?

**Decision-Making Questions**:
- Do I have enough information to say yes?
- What's still unclear or missing?
- How does this compare to alternatives?
- What's being asked of me, specifically?

**Step 2.1.3: Document Findings**

For each stakeholder perspective, note:
- [ ] **Value Proposition Clarity**: Clear | Unclear | Missing
- [ ] **Concerns Addressed**: Yes | Partially | No
- [ ] **Language Appropriateness**: Good | Needs adjustment | Poor
- [ ] **Specific Issues**: List 3-5 key findings
- [ ] **Strengths**: What works well for this stakeholder
- [ ] **Gaps**: What's missing or unclear
- [ ] **Recommended Improvements**: 2-3 specific suggestions

### Step 3: Cross-Stakeholder Analysis (30-45 minutes)

#### 3.1 Identify Patterns
- [ ] Which stakeholder perspectives are well-served?
- [ ] Which perspectives are underrepresented or missing?
- [ ] Are there conflicting messages to different stakeholders?
- [ ] Does one stakeholder voice dominate?
- [ ] Are there universal gaps affecting all stakeholders?

#### 3.2 Assess Messaging Effectiveness
- [ ] What's the dominant tone/voice? (Technical? Marketing? Academic?)
- [ ] Is language accessible to all target stakeholders?
- [ ] Are examples and evidence types appropriate?
- [ ] Are calls-to-action clear and appropriate per stakeholder?
- [ ] Is the document trying to serve too many audiences at once?

#### 3.3 Evaluate Value Propositions
- [ ] For each key stakeholder, is their "what's in it for me?" answer clear?
- [ ] Are benefits framed from stakeholder perspective (not organization perspective)?
- [ ] Are stakeholder-specific concerns acknowledged and addressed?
- [ ] Is the ask proportional to the value offered?

### Step 4: Empathy Mapping (Optional, 30-45 minutes)

For priority stakeholders or complex alignment issues, create empathy maps:

#### 4.1 Think & Feel
- [ ] What matters most to this stakeholder?
- [ ] What worries keep them up at night?
- [ ] What would make them excited about this?
- [ ] What would make them skeptical?

#### 4.2 Hear
- [ ] What do peers/colleagues tell them?
- [ ] What industry trends influence them?
- [ ] What advice do they receive?
- [ ] What criticisms do they face?

#### 4.3 See
- [ ] What's in their daily environment?
- [ ] What evidence do they observe?
- [ ] What examples do they encounter?
- [ ] What market/community conditions do they see?

#### 4.4 Say & Do
- [ ] What are their public statements?
- [ ] What actions do they take?
- [ ] How do they make decisions?
- [ ] What behaviors do they exhibit?

#### 4.5 Pains
- [ ] Frustrations they want to avoid
- [ ] Obstacles they face
- [ ] Risks they fear
- [ ] Problems they need solved

#### 4.6 Gains
- [ ] What they want to achieve
- [ ] What success looks like to them
- [ ] How they measure progress
- [ ] What would delight them

### Step 5: Scoring & Prioritization (15-20 minutes)

#### 5.1 Calculate Stakeholder Alignment Score

**Value Proposition Clarity (30 points)**:
- All key stakeholders have clear value: 25-30
- Most stakeholders have clear value: 15-24
- Some stakeholders have clear value: 5-14
- Value unclear for most stakeholders: 0-4

**Concern Addressing (25 points)**:
- All known concerns addressed: 20-25
- Most concerns addressed: 10-19
- Some concerns addressed: 5-9
- Few/no concerns addressed: 0-4

**Language Appropriateness (20 points)**:
- Perfect tone/language for all audiences: 16-20
- Good fit for most audiences: 10-15
- Some language issues: 5-9
- Poor language fit: 0-4

**Perspective Balance (15 points)**:
- All key voices represented: 12-15
- Most voices represented: 7-11
- Some voices represented: 3-6
- Imbalanced or single perspective: 0-2

**Call-to-Action Fit (10 points)**:
- CTAs perfect for each stakeholder: 8-10
- CTAs mostly appropriate: 5-7
- CTAs need adjustment: 2-4
- CTAs inappropriate or missing: 0-1

**Total Alignment Score**: ___/100

#### 5.2 Prioritize Issues

Sort findings by priority:
- **CRITICAL**: Document alienates essential stakeholder, unclear value for primary audience
- **HIGH**: Important stakeholder concerns unaddressed, messaging ineffective
- **MEDIUM**: Opportunities for better alignment, secondary stakeholder gaps
- **LOW**: Nice-to-have improvements, optional enhancements

### Step 6: Task Generation (20-30 minutes)

#### 6.1 Create Stakeholder-Specific Tasks

For each significant finding, generate a task:
- Use task template from Stakeholder Advocate persona
- Include stakeholder perspective, current vs recommended messaging
- Provide specific, actionable recommendations
- Add example language where helpful
- Tag with appropriate priority

#### 6.2 Create Cross-Stakeholder Tasks

If multiple stakeholders affected by same issue:
- Create a single task addressing all perspectives
- Or create stakeholder-specific document variants
- Or recommend splitting document by audience

### Step 7: Report Generation (30-45 minutes)

#### 7.1 Create Stakeholder Review Report

Use template: `_templates/stakeholder_review_report.md`

Include:
- Executive summary of overall alignment
- Findings by stakeholder perspective
- Messaging effectiveness analysis
- Value proposition assessment
- Alignment score breakdown
- Stakeholder-specific recommendations
- Priority actions

#### 7.2 Save Report

Save to: `_vault_maintenance/stakeholders/stakeholder_reviews/[document-name]_review_YYYY-MM-DD.md`

#### 7.3 Update State File

Update `stakeholder_advocate_state.md`:
- Document review completion
- Update metrics
- Record alignment score
- Note key findings
- Plan next review focus

### Step 8: Action & Follow-Up (Ongoing)

#### 8.1 Share Findings
- Add tasks to queue for appropriate personas (Curator, Quality Inspector)
- Share critical findings with relevant stakeholders
- Coordinate with other personas on improvements

#### 8.2 Track Implementation
- Monitor task completion
- Verify improvements address stakeholder concerns
- Re-review documents after significant changes

#### 8.3 Validate with Real Stakeholders (When Possible)
- Test messaging with actual stakeholder representatives
- Gather feedback from funder conversations
- Incorporate community input
- Update stakeholder personas based on real-world insights

## Workflow Variants

### Quick Stakeholder Check (30 minutes)
For minor updates or quick validations:
1. Select 2-3 most relevant stakeholder perspectives
2. Quick read from each perspective
3. Note major alignment issues only
4. Generate critical tasks only
5. Brief findings summary (no full report)

### Deep Stakeholder Analysis (4-6 hours)
For major documents or pre-launch reviews:
1. Review from all 5 stakeholder perspectives
2. Create empathy maps for each key stakeholder
3. Conduct cross-stakeholder analysis
4. Generate comprehensive tasks
5. Create detailed report with specific messaging recommendations
6. Develop stakeholder-specific document variants if needed

### Targeted Stakeholder Review (1-2 hours)
For stakeholder-specific documents:
1. Review from single stakeholder perspective only
2. Deep dive into that stakeholder's concerns and motivations
3. Detailed empathy mapping
4. Specific messaging recommendations
5. Stakeholder-focused report

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Superficial Perspective-Taking**: Don't just intellectually consider stakeholders - truly adopt their mindset and concerns
2. **Founder Bias**: Don't default to founder/organization perspective - stay in stakeholder view
3. **One-Size-Fits-All**: Don't assume messaging that works for one stakeholder works for all
4. **Avoiding Elephants**: Don't skip known stakeholder concerns - address them head-on
5. **Vague Recommendations**: Don't just say "improve messaging" - provide specific language suggestions
6. **Ignoring Context**: Don't review in isolation - consider stakeholder's full context and environment
7. **Assuming Intent = Impact**: Don't assume what you mean to say is what stakeholders hear

## Tips for Effective Stakeholder Reviews

1. **Read Stakeholder Persona First**: Always re-read the full persona profile before reviewing from their perspective
2. **Use Real Names**: Think of a specific real person who fits the stakeholder persona (even if fictional)
3. **Switch Contexts Completely**: Between stakeholder reviews, take a break to switch mental contexts
4. **Ask "Would I...?"**: For each stakeholder, ask "Would I fund/join/support/partner based on this?"
5. **Look for Red Flags**: What would make this stakeholder immediately say "no"?
6. **Provide Examples**: Always include example language or specific suggestions, not just critique
7. **Test on Real People**: When possible, validate findings with actual stakeholder representatives
8. **Update Personas**: If real-world stakeholder feedback differs from persona, update the persona
