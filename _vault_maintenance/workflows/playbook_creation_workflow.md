## Overview

This workflow guides the creation of comprehensive execution playbooks that transform strategic goals into actionable, week-by-week implementation plans. Each playbook breaks down complex processes into manageable steps with clear dependencies, resource requirements, and success criteria.

---

## When to Create a Playbook

Create an execution playbook when:

- ✅ A strategic goal is vague or lacks implementation detail
- ✅ A process is complex with multiple dependencies
- ✅ Timeline estimation is uncertain or disputed
- ✅ Resource requirements are unclear
- ✅ External dependencies or approvals are involved
- ✅ The process is critical to project success
- ✅ Similar processes will be repeated (template value)
- ✅ Execution risk is high without detailed planning

**Examples**: gGmbH registration, land acquisition, funding campaigns, partnership development, infrastructure construction

## Playbook Creation Process

### Phase 1: Research & Discovery (2-4 hours)

#### Step 1.1: Understand the Goal
- [ ] Read relevant strategic documents
- [ ] Identify the specific end-state desired
- [ ] Define clear success criteria
- [ ] Understand why this matters to the project
- [ ] Note any timeline constraints

#### Step 1.2: Research Best Practices
- [ ] Search for similar processes others have executed
- [ ] Review case studies and lessons learned
- [ ] Identify common pitfalls and solutions
- [ ] Find process templates if available
- [ ] Consult Knowledge Synthesizer for research insights

#### Step 1.3: Identify Expertise Sources
- [ ] Who has done this before?
- [ ] What experts should be consulted?
- [ ] What documentation exists (government, industry)?
- [ ] What legal or regulatory requirements apply?
- [ ] What professional help is needed?

**Output**: Research summary document with sources, best practices, and expert insights

---

### Phase 2: Process Breakdown (3-5 hours)

#### Step 2.1: List All Major Steps
- [ ] Brainstorm every step needed from start to finish
- [ ] Group steps into logical phases or milestones
- [ ] Order steps chronologically
- [ ] Identify decision points that create branches
- [ ] Note steps that could run in parallel

**Technique**: Reverse engineer from the end goal backward to the starting point

#### Step 2.2: Define Prerequisites
For each major step:
- [ ] What must exist before this step can start?
- [ ] What approvals or permissions are needed?
- [ ] What resources must be acquired first?
- [ ] What knowledge or skills are required?
- [ ] What external parties must be engaged?

#### Step 2.3: Identify Dependencies
- [ ] Map which steps depend on which others
- [ ] Identify the critical path (longest chain)
- [ ] Find opportunities for parallel execution
- [ ] Flag external dependencies (not under your control)
- [ ] Note seasonal or timing constraints

**Tool**: Use dependency map template

#### Step 2.4: Estimate Time Requirements
For each step:
- [ ] Research typical duration for this activity
- [ ] Account for learning curve if new to you
- [ ] Add buffer for delays and unknowns (20-30%)
- [ ] Consider external party responsiveness
- [ ] Note best case, worst case, and realistic case

**Reality Check**: Compare total time to available time; identify gaps

---

### Phase 3: Resource Planning (2-3 hours)

#### Step 3.1: Calculate Time Investment
- [ ] Sum total person-hours for all steps
- [ ] Break down by role/expertise type
- [ ] Identify peak workload periods
- [ ] Validate against team capacity
- [ ] Plan for time conflicts

#### Step 3.2: Estimate Financial Costs
For each step:
- [ ] Professional fees (lawyers, consultants)
- [ ] Government fees (registrations, permits)
- [ ] Materials and supplies
- [ ] Travel and logistics
- [ ] Contingency buffer (10-20%)

**Output**: Budget breakdown by step and category

#### Step 3.3: Identify Expertise Requirements
- [ ] What specialized skills are needed?
- [ ] What knowledge gaps exist on current team?
- [ ] Where can expertise be acquired? (hire, volunteer, advisor, consultant)
- [ ] What training or learning is needed?
- [ ] What's the backup plan if expertise unavailable?

#### Step 3.4: List Tools & Materials
- [ ] Software or technology needed
- [ ] Physical materials required
- [ ] Templates or documents needed
- [ ] Equipment or facilities required
- [ ] Access to databases or resources

---

### Phase 4: Playbook Drafting (4-6 hours)

#### Step 4.1: Structure the Playbook
Use the execution playbook template:
1. Goal & Success Criteria
2. Prerequisites & Dependencies
3. Resources Required
4. Step-by-Step Process (weekly breakdown)
5. Decision Points & Branching Paths
6. Templates & Checklists
7. Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid
8. Success Metrics & Validation
9. Next Steps After Completion

#### Step 4.2: Write Week-by-Week Breakdown
For each week:
- [ ] Define specific actions to take
- [ ] List deliverables for the week
- [ ] Note dependencies that must be met
- [ ] Identify decision points
- [ ] Specify validation checkpoints
- [ ] Estimate time commitment
- [ ] Flag potential blockers

**Formatting**: Use clear headers, checklists, and action-oriented language

#### Step 4.3: Document Decision Points
For each major decision:
- [ ] What decision must be made?
- [ ] What information is needed to decide?
- [ ] What are the options?
- [ ] What are consequences of each option?
- [ ] Who should make the decision?
- [ ] How to decide (criteria, process)?

**Technique**: Use decision trees for complex choices

#### Step 4.4: Create Templates & Checklists
- [ ] Draft any documents needed (emails, forms, contracts)
- [ ] Create checklists for complex steps
- [ ] Build evaluation scorecards if applicable
- [ ] Design tracking spreadsheets if helpful
- [ ] Provide example language and formats

**Principle**: Make it as easy as possible to execute; remove friction

---

### Phase 5: Risk & Contingency Planning (2-3 hours)

#### Step 5.1: Identify Potential Blockers
For each step, ask:
- [ ] What could go wrong?
- [ ] What external factors could cause delays?
- [ ] What assumptions might be wrong?
- [ ] What dependencies could fail?
- [ ] What skills or resources might be unavailable?

#### Step 5.2: Document Common Pitfalls
- [ ] Research what mistakes others made
- [ ] Identify warning signs of problems
- [ ] Note what to avoid
- [ ] Provide prevention strategies
- [ ] Include recovery procedures if problems occur

#### Step 5.3: Create Backup Plans
For critical path items:
- [ ] What's Plan B if this fails?
- [ ] What alternative approaches exist?
- [ ] How to pivot if circumstances change?
- [ ] What early warning signs to watch for?
- [ ] When to abandon vs persist?

**Principle**: Every critical step needs a contingency plan

---

### Phase 6: Validation & Refinement (1-2 hours)

#### Step 6.1: Reality Check the Playbook
- [ ] Could someone unfamiliar execute this?
- [ ] Are time estimates realistic?
- [ ] Are resources actually available?
- [ ] Are dependencies controllable?
- [ ] Is the critical path reasonable?

#### Step 6.2: Get Expert Feedback (Optional)
- [ ] Share draft with someone who has done this
- [ ] Ask for blind spots you missed
- [ ] Validate time and cost estimates
- [ ] Get input on common pitfalls
- [ ] Incorporate feedback

#### Step 6.3: Cross-Check with Strategic Documents
- [ ] Does this align with strategic vision?
- [ ] Do timelines match strategic plan?
- [ ] Do costs fit within budget?
- [ ] Does approach match organizational values?
- [ ] Are stakeholder considerations included?

**Coordinate**: Share with Strategic Advisor for assumption validation

#### Step 6.4: Finalize and Document
- [ ] Incorporate all feedback
- [ ] Ensure consistent formatting
- [ ] Add version number and date
- [ ] Note sources and references
- [ ] Save to `_vault_maintenance/playbooks/`

## Common Pitfalls in Playbook Creation

### 1. Staying Too High-Level
**Problem**: Steps like "Establish gGmbH" without breakdown
**Solution**: Keep asking "How exactly?" until you reach concrete actions

### 2. Underestimating Time
**Problem**: No buffer for delays, learning curves, or external dependencies
**Solution**: Always add 20-30% buffer; research actual timelines from similar projects

### 3. Ignoring Dependencies
**Problem**: Assuming steps can happen whenever, missing critical path
**Solution**: Map every dependency; identify what blocks what

### 4. Missing Resources
**Problem**: Not identifying required expertise, budget, or tools
**Solution**: Explicitly list all resources needed for each step

### 5. No Backup Plans
**Problem**: Critical steps with no contingency if they fail
**Solution**: Every critical path item needs a Plan B

### 6. Vague Success Criteria
**Problem**: "Complete registration" without defining how to verify
**Solution**: Define measurable completion criteria for every step

### 7. Creating and Forgetting
**Problem**: Playbook created but never updated based on reality
**Solution**: Treat playbooks as living documents; update during execution
