# Bookmark Synthesis Workflow

## Purpose
This workflow defines the standard process for the Knowledge Synthesizer to transform research bookmarks into actionable insights and documentation enhancements.

## When to Run Synthesis

- **Initial Bootstrap**: Process priority bookmark categories to support Year 1 Bootstrap phase
- **Documentation Gap Filling**: When Curator identifies knowledge gaps needing research
- **Strategic Question Support**: When Strategic Advisor needs evidence for assumption validation
- **Playbook Research**: When Implementation Coach needs best practices for execution plans
- **Quarterly Research Cycle**: Regular synthesis of new research every 3 months
- **On Demand**: When specific research questions arise

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Synthesis Scoping (10-15 minutes)

**Actions:**
- [ ] Identify research question or topic area
- [ ] Determine synthesis priority (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- [ ] Define synthesis scope (number of bookmarks, categories)
- [ ] Identify target documentation files to enhance
- [ ] Load Knowledge Synthesizer state file
- [ ] Review previous synthesis reports for context
- [ ] Check for related synthesis already completed

**Inputs:**
- Research question or topic area
- Bookmark collection access
- Documentation gap list (from Curator)
- Strategic questions (from Strategic Advisor)

**Output:** Clear synthesis scope and goals

**Time Estimate:** 10-15 minutes

---

### 2. Bookmark Collection & Categorization (20-40 minutes)

**Actions:**
- [ ] Access bookmark collection (export file or bookmark manager)
- [ ] Filter bookmarks by relevant tags/categories
- [ ] Remove duplicates and broken links
- [ ] Quick scan of titles/descriptions
- [ ] Categorize into sub-themes if needed
- [ ] Prioritize sources (academic > industry > blogs)
- [ ] Note source recency and geographic relevance
- [ ] Create working list of bookmarks to analyze (typically 20-50)

**Quality Checks:**
- [ ] Source credibility assessment
- [ ] Recency check (prefer last 5 years for methodology)
- [ ] Relevance to Eco Balance context (scale, geography, stage)
- [ ] Diversity of perspectives (avoid single-viewpoint bias)

**Output:** Organized, prioritized list of bookmarks to synthesize

**Time Estimate:**
- Small synthesis (20-30 bookmarks): 20 minutes
- Medium synthesis (40-60 bookmarks): 30 minutes
- Large synthesis (80-100 bookmarks): 40 minutes

---

### 3. Source Analysis (2-8 hours)

**Actions:**

- [ ] Methodologies or approaches described
- [ ] Evidence strength (peer-reviewed, case study, opinion)
- [ ] Applicability to 1-hectare bootstrap context
- [ ] Notable quotes or data points
- [ ] Related sources mentioned

**Analysis Techniques:**
- **Cluster Reading**: Group similar sources, analyze patterns

## Best Practices

### Synthesis Quality
1. **Triangulate Findings**: Don't trust single sources for critical claims
2. **Note Evidence Strength**: Peer-reviewed > case study > expert opinion
3. **Filter for Context**: Large-scale forestry ≠ 1-hectare restoration
4. **Document Limitations**: Note what research doesn't tell us
5. **Preserve Nuance**: "Most studies show X, but Y found Z" is better than "Research proves X"

### Integration Quality
1. **Enhance, Don't Replace**: Add value to existing content
2. **Cite Thoroughly**: Every research claim needs a source
3. **Show Relevance**: Explain why this research matters here
4. **Maintain Voice**: Match existing documentation style
5. **Link Synthesis**: Reference full synthesis report for details

### Efficiency
1. **Batch Similar Sources**: Analyze restoration methods together
2. **Take Good Notes**: Save time in synthesis phase
3. **Use Templates**: Consistent structure speeds writing
4. **Reuse Knowledge**: Build on previous synthesis work
5. **Know When to Stop**: Perfect is enemy of good

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Analysis Phase
- ❌ Reading everything deeply (skim first, dive on high-value only)
- ❌ Taking verbatim quotes instead of extracting insights
- ❌ Ignoring source credibility and recency
- ❌ Cherry-picking evidence to support pre-existing beliefs

### Synthesis Phase
- ❌ Reporting findings without interpretation
- ❌ Missing patterns because analyzing sources in isolation
- ❌ Treating all sources as equally credible
- ❌ Ignoring contradictions or debates in research

### Integration Phase
- ❌ Copy-pasting research without adaptation
- ❌ Adding citations without context
- ❌ Overwhelming documentation with too many sources
- ❌ Forgetting to update cross-references

---

A successful synthesis results in:

- ✅ **Clear Insights**: 5-10 actionable findings extracted
- ✅ **Best Practices**: 3-5 proven practices identified
- ✅ **Evidence Integration**: Research citations added to 3+ files
- ✅ **Complete Report**: Synthesis report following template
- ✅ **Knowledge Connections**: Relationships between concepts mapped
