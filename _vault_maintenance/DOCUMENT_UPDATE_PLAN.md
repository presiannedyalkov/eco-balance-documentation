**Created**: 2025-11-09
**Updated**: 2025-11-09
**Purpose**: Comprehensive plan to update all strategic documents based on assumptions audit findings and user decisions
**Status**: READY TO EXECUTE - All Tier 1 decisions made ✅

---

## 🎯 Decision Tracking

**ALL TIER 1 DECISIONS MADE** ✅

### Decision 1: Legal Structure ✅ DECIDED
- [x] **e.V.** (registered association) for Year 1-3
- [x] Convert to gGmbH in Year 3-5 when revenue justifies it (>€100k/year OR seeking €200k+ investment)
- **Budget Impact**: Save €39,500 for operations
- **Timeline Impact**: 4-8 weeks registration (not 3-6 months)
- **Governance**: 7+ founding members, democratic voting, elected board

### Decision 2: Geographic Location ✅ DECIDED (Flexible/Opportunistic)
- [x] **Flexible across Europe** (Germany, Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, etc.)
- **Decision Criteria** (priority order):
  1. Grant/funding opportunities (€20-50k restoration grants)
  2. Mentorship/partnership opportunities (experienced practitioners)
  3. Land availability and cost (€5-15k for 1ha)
  4. Legal/administrative feasibility
- **Strong Candidates**:
  - Germany: Citizenship, jobs, familiar systems, temperate ecosystem (baseline)
  - Portugal: Lower costs (land €5-15k, living €10-18k), Mediterranean climate (appealing)
  - Other EU: Open to opportunities
- **Decision Timeline**: Finalize when opportunity emerges, or default Germany within 6 months
- **Impact**: Documents will state flexibility strategy, methodology adapts to chosen location

### Decision 3: Budget Source ✅ DECIDED (Hybrid Two-Phase Model)
- [x] **Phase 0: Crowdfunding Campaign** (one-time capex)
  - Target: €15,000 conservative, €20-25k optimistic, €30k+ stretch
  - Purpose: Buy land (€8-15k) + major equipment (€5-10k)
  - Timeline: 3-6 months audience building + 30-60 day campaign
  - Campaign costs: €1.5-5k (10-20% of raised amount)
  - Backup: If <€12k raised, lease land instead of buy

- [x] **Phase 1-3: Annual Operating Budget** (€20-30k/year recurring)
  - Founders contribution: €10-15k/year (from employment income)
  - Donations: €5-10k/year (50-100 small donors × €50-200)
  - Small revenues: €5-10k/year (workshops, consulting, plant sales, partnerships)
  - Purpose: Operations, maintenance, growth, eventual salaries

### Decision 4: Team Reality ✅ DECIDED (Part-Time, Gradual Build)
- [x] **Team size**: 1-2 founders
- [x] **Year 1-2**: Keep full-time jobs, 15-25 hr/week on project
- [x] **Year 2-4**: Transition to part-time jobs (4 days/week), 25-35 hr/week on project
- [x] **Year 4+**: Full-time project (40-60 hr/week) when revenue is €30-50k/year stable
- **Living expenses**: Covered by jobs (no financial crisis, no €11-21k gap to fill)
- **Financial runway**: Indefinite (jobs sustain founders, project doesn't need to pay salaries immediately)
- **Burnout risk**: LOW (sustainable pace, not 60-84 hr/week)

### Decision 5: Timeline ✅ DECIDED (12-18 Months Phased)
- [x] **Realistic timeline**: 12-18 months (not 90 days)
- **Rationale**: Part-time work (15-25 hr/week) = 3-4x longer than full-time assumptions
- **Work capacity math**: 15-25 hr/week × 52 weeks = 780-1,300 hr/year (same as 60 hr/week × 12 weeks)
- **Contingency buffer**: 20-30% added to all milestones
- **Phased approach**:
  - Months 1-6: Preparation & Crowdfunding
  - Months 7-12: Land Acquisition & Setup
  - Months 13-24 (Year 2): Initial Restoration Work
  - Years 3-4: Expansion & Revenue Maturation

## 📋 UPDATE GROUPS (Revised Based on Decisions)

### GROUP A: Legal Structure Changes (e.V. Decision) ✅ READY

**Files to Update**: 6 files
**Dependencies**: None (e.V. decision is made)
**Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes
**Status**: Can execute immediately

#### File 10: Organizational_Structure.md
**Changes Required**:
- **Line 53-59**: Change legal structure from gGmbH to e.V.
- **Line 67-72**: Update bootstrap strategy to reflect e.V. Year 1-3, optional gGmbH conversion Year 3-5
- **Line 91-92**: Change from "3-5 founders × €5-8k capital" to "7+ founding members (no capital required)"

- **Section "Legal Structure Decision"**: Complete rewrite for e.V. rationale
- **Section "Shareholders"**: Rename to "Members" and update for democratic governance
- **Add location flexibility**: State registration in Germany (e.V.) OR Portugal (Associação) OR other EU depending on final location

**New content template**:
```markdown
### Legal Structure: e.V. (eingetragener Verein) - Year 1-3

**Formation Cost**: €500 (registration, statutes, legal fees in Germany)
**Alternative**: €500-2,000 (Portuguese Associação or equivalent if final location is not Germany)
**Timeline**: 4-8 weeks from application to registration
**Requirements**: Minimum 7 founding members, democratic statutes

**Governance**: Member assembly (democratic voting), elected board of 3-5 directors

**Conversion Strategy**:
- Year 1-3: Operate as e.V./Associação, prove model, build revenue
- Year 3-5: Evaluate conversion to gGmbH if ALL of:
  - Annual revenue >€100k/year (commercial activities significant)
  - Seeking impact investment >€200k (equity investors required)
  - Commercial revenue > grant/donation revenue (business model shift)

**Why e.V. for Bootstrap Phase**:
- Cost: €500 vs €40,000 (saves €39,500 for operations)
- Speed: 4-8 weeks vs 3-6 months
- Flexibility: Same tax-exempt status, grant access, donation capability
- Risk: Lower financial barrier if model needs adjustment

- **Two-Phase Financial Model**: Complete rewrite of funding section:
  - Phase 0: Crowdfunding €15-25k (one-time capex for land + equipment)
  - Phase 1-3: €20-30k/year recurring (founders + donations + revenue)
- **Budget reallocation**: €39,500 saved from e.V. → no longer needed, use crowdfunding + annual ops model
- **Governance references**: Update shareholder language to member/association language

### GROUP B: Geographic Location Changes ✅ READY

**Files to Update**: 8 files
**Dependencies**: Location decision is flexible/opportunistic (documented)
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours
**Status**: Update to reflect FLEXIBILITY strategy (not pick one location)

#### Revised Approach: Document Flexibility, Not Fixed Location

Instead of picking Germany OR Portugal, update documents to state:

**All Location-Specific Files (02, 10, 12, 15, 20, 21, 30, 44)**:

**Add Flexibility Statement**:
```markdown
### Geographic Strategy: Opportunistic Within Europe

**Decision Criteria** (priority order):
1. Grant/funding opportunities (€20-50k restoration grants in specific regions)
2. Mentorship/partnership opportunities (experienced practitioners offering support)
3. Land availability and cost (€5-15k for 1ha accessible land)
4. Legal/administrative feasibility (faster registration, simpler bureaucracy)

**Strong Candidate Locations**:
- **Germany**: Citizenship, existing base, familiar systems, temperate forest restoration
  - Land: €15-30k/ha | Living: €15-30k/year | Legal: e.V. €500 | Climate: 700-800mm rain
- **Portugal**: Lower costs, Mediterranean climate, appealing lifestyle
  - Land: €5-15k/ha | Living: €10-18k/year | Legal: Associação €500-2k | Climate: 400-600mm rain
- **Other EU**: Open to opportunities (Spain, France, Italy, etc.) based on grants/partnerships

**Decision Timeline**: Location will be finalized when:
- Specific grant/project opportunity emerges (e.g., €30k restoration grant in Region X), OR
- Land at exceptional price/terms becomes available, OR
- Strong partnership/mentorship offer materializes, OR
- Within 6 months if no opportunities emerge (default to Germany for practical reasons)

**Methodology Adaptation**: Restoration approach will adapt to chosen location:
- Temperate (Germany, N. France, etc.): Oak/Beech/Birch forest regeneration, 700-800mm rain
- Mediterranean (Portugal, Spain, S. France, Italy): Cork Oak/Holm Oak/Pine, drought-adapted, 400-600mm rain
- Species lists, water strategies, planting seasons customized to final location
```

**File-Specific Changes**:

**File 02 (Vision)**:
- Remove conflicting statements
- Replace with flexibility strategy above
- Keep both Germany and Portugal as strong candidates
- Add other EU countries as possibilities

**File 10 (Org)**:
- Registration location: "TBD - e.V. in Germany OR Associação in Portugal OR equivalent in other EU country"
- Cost: €500-2,000 depending on country
- Timeline: 4-8 weeks (varies by country bureaucracy)

**File 12 (Team)**:
- Remove "Primary office: Bonn, Germany"
- Replace with: "Primary office: TBD (Germany, Portugal, or other EU based on final location decision)"
- Remove "Field site: Germany (temperate climate zone)"
- Replace with: "Field site: TBD (climate zone will determine restoration approach)"

**File 15, 44 (Site Selection)**:
- Provide site selection criteria for BOTH temperate and Mediterranean climates
- List regions in both Germany and Portugal (and other EU countries)
- State final selection depends on grant opportunities and land availability

**File 20 (Restoration Methodology)**:
- Provide TWO methodology sections:
  - **Temperate Approach** (if Germany, N. France, etc.): Oak, Beech, Birch, 700-800mm rain
  - **Mediterranean Approach** (if Portugal, Spain, S. France, Italy): Cork Oak, Holm Oak, Pine, 400-600mm rain
- State clearly: "Final species selection and restoration methods will be determined by chosen location"

**File 21 (Technology)**:
- Provide water harvesting calculations for BOTH rainfall scenarios:
  - Temperate: 700-800mm/year → rainwater covers 20-30%
  - Mediterranean: 400-600mm/year → rainwater covers 10-20% (well more critical)
- Solar production for both:
  - Germany: 3-4 hr winter sun
  - Portugal: 5-6 hr winter sun

**File 30 (Business Model)**:
- Budget ranges to cover both scenarios:
  - Land: €5-30k (Portugal low end, Germany high end)
  - Living: €10-30k/person/year (Portugal low end, Germany high end)
  - Legal: €500-2,000 (Germany e.V. vs Portugal Associação)

```markdown
## Financial Readiness: Two-Phase Hybrid Model

**Current Status** (as of planning phase):
- Founders: CONFIRMED €10-15k/year available from employment income
- Crowdfunding: NOT YET launched (requires 3-6 months prep + campaign)
- Donations: NOT YET built (will build from crowdfunding supporters)
- Revenue: NOT YET generating (will start Year 1 with €5-10k target)

**Timeline to Financial Readiness**:
- Months 1-6: Crowdfunding campaign → €15-25k capex
- Year 1: Annual budget €20-30k operational (founders + donations + revenue)
- Year 2-3: Same annual budget, building toward self-sufficiency
- Year 4+: Target €30-50k/year to support full-time transition

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Jobs provide founder income (no financial crisis if project revenue low)
- Crowdfunding failure backup: Lease land, incremental build with annual budget only
- Revenue targets are supplemental (not critical for founder survival)
```

- Flexibility: Can work on project evenings/weekends

**Impact on Timeline**:
- Work capacity: 15-25 hr/week × 52 weeks = 780-1,300 hr/year
- Equivalent to: 60 hr/week × 13-22 weeks full-time
- Therefore: "90-day plan" takes 12-18 months at part-time pace
- Benefit: Sustainable, low burnout risk, time to learn and adjust

### Year 2-4: Transition Period (1-2 Founders)

**Work Commitment**: 25-35 hours/week
- Employment: Reduce to 80% jobs (4 days/week instead of 5)
- Project time: 3 days/week = 24-30 hr/week
- **Total**: 25-35 hr/week on project

**Trigger for Transition**:
- Project revenue: €15-25k/year (covers some lost employment income)
- Founders comfortable: Initial results validate model
- Timeline: Year 2-3 based on progress

### Year 4+: Full-Time Project (1-2 Founders)

**Work Commitment**: 40-60 hours/week
- Employment: Quit jobs completely OR transition to consulting (project-related)
- Project time: Full-time dedication

**Trigger for Transition**:
- Project revenue: €30-50k/year stable (can support founders)
- OR: Consulting income: €30-50k/year (restoration consulting replaces jobs)
- Founders ready: Model proven, ready to scale

**Financial Reality Check**:

| Phase | Jobs Income | Project Income | Total | Living Expenses | Viable? |
|-------|-------------|----------------|-------|-----------------|---------|
| **Year 1-2 (Part-time)** | €30-50k | €0-5k | €30-55k | €11-21k | ✅ Yes |
| **Year 2-4 (80% jobs)** | €24-40k | €10-25k | €34-65k | €11-21k | ✅ Yes |
| **Year 4+ (Full-time project)** | €0 | €30-50k | €30-50k | €11-21k | ✅ Yes (if revenue target hit) |

**Burnout Risk Assessment**:
- Year 1-2 (part-time): LOW (sustainable pace, jobs provide stability)
- Year 2-4 (transition): MEDIUM (busier but manageable, increasing project revenue provides validation)
- Year 4+ (full-time): LOW (doing what you love full-time, financially supported)

**Skill Requirements** (1-2 founders must cover):
- Restoration ecology: Species ID, planting, soil science
- Project management: Planning, coordination, time management
- Fundraising: Crowdfunding, donor relations, grant writing
- Communications: Social media, email, storytelling
- Basic construction: Infrastructure setup, tool use
- Financial: Budgeting, bookkeeping, reporting

**Skill Gaps Strategy**:
- Volunteers: Recruit for specific skills (e.g., video editing, graphic design)
- Advisors: 5-7 advisors for specialized knowledge (ecology, legal, finance)
- Learning: Online courses, workshops, learning by doing
- Partnerships: Universities for scientific expertise, NGOs for restoration guidance
```

#### File 43 (Operations Plan)
**Changes Required**:
- Update daily schedule from "7am-7pm, 12 hours/day" to realistic part-time schedule:
  - **Weekday evenings**: 2-3 hours (6pm-9pm) after full-time job
  - **Weekends**: 8-10 hours Saturday + 6-8 hours Sunday = 14-18 hr/week
  - **Total**: 18-24 hr/week realistic
- Remove unrealistic assumptions about founder availability
- Add note: "Full-time intensity operations begin Year 3-4 when founders transition"
