4. ⏳ **Team reality** - How many founders, full/part-time, savings runway?
5. ⏳ **Timeline decision** - 90 days, 120 days, 180 days, or longer?

### Phase 2: Execute Updates (DO SECOND)

2. **GROUP B**: Geographic changes (1-4 hours depending on location)
3. **GROUP C**: Budget reconciliation (45-60 min)
4. **GROUP D**: Team & timeline reality (30-45 min)
5. **GROUP E**: Cross-cutting corrections (1-2 hours)

**Total estimated time**: 4-8 hours depending on location choice

### Phase 3: Validation (DO THIRD)
1. Run link checker (ensure internal links still work)
2. Read updated files for consistency
3. Check that all contradictions from CONTRADICTIONS.md are resolved
4. Verify budget math adds up
5. Confirm timeline is realistic

## 🎯 DECISION MAKING HELPER

**Still deciding on location? Ask yourself**:
1. Where do I currently live? (Germany or Portugal or other?)
2. Where do I want to live for 2-3 years? (On-site required Year 1-3)
3. Which climate/ecosystem am I passionate about? (Temperate forest vs Mediterranean dryland)
4. Where is my network? (Volunteers, advisors, family support)
5. What land can I afford? (€5-15k Portugal vs €15-30k Germany)

**Still deciding on budget source? Ask yourself**:
1. Do I have €20-30k in savings RIGHT NOW?
2. Do I have 10-20 friends/family I could ask for €500-2,000 each?
3. Am I willing to spend 3-6 months building crowdfunding audience before starting?
4. Should I apply for grants first (6-12 month delay but guaranteed funding)?
5. Can I start SMALLER with €10-15k and scale up? (0.5ha pilot, lease not buy)

**Still deciding on timeline? Ask yourself**:
1. Am I working on this FULL-TIME (40-60 hr/week) or part-time?
2. If full-time: Can I survive 6-12 months with no income?
3. If part-time: How many hours/week realistically? (15-20? 25-30?)
4. What's my REAL deadline? (Is 90 days a hard constraint or aspirational?)
5. What happens if I take 2x longer than planned? (6 months → 12 months)
