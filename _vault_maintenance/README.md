## 🎯 FOR INTERACTIVE MAINTENANCE (MANUAL/CONVERSATIONAL)

**Preparing v2.0.0 Bootstrap Model for Release**

→ **Start Here**: Read [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) - The complete two-phase process  
→ **Phase 1 (Audit)**: Use [AUDIT_TASKS.md](AUDIT_TASKS.md) - Check every file systematically  
→ **Phase 2 (Fix)**: Use [FIX_TASKS.md](FIX_TASKS.md) - Fix all issues by priority

**The Process**: 
1. **AUDIT** every file with every persona (~270 tasks) → Document issues in FIX_TASKS.md
2. **FIX** all documented issues by priority (CRITICAL → LOW)
3. Complete audit BEFORE starting fixes (avoid rework!)

**Goal**: Make v2.0.0 clean, consistent, and ready for release  
**Time Required**: ~30-50 hours over 3-4 weeks

## Overview

This directory contains a sophisticated AI-driven vault maintenance system designed to keep the Eco Restoration Project documentation clean, organized, and optimized. The system operates through specialized personas, each with distinct responsibilities and workflows.

## System Architecture

```

├── personas/              # AI persona definitions and skills
├── tasks/                 # Task management and tracking
├── workflows/             # Process templates and procedures

```

## Core Principles

1. **Analyze First**: Every persona begins by analyzing the current state
2. **Plan Before Acting**: Tasks are created but not immediately executed
3. **Track Everything**: All changes and decisions are documented
4. **Collaborate**: Personas work together, not in isolation
5. **Preserve History**: Nothing is deleted; content is archived when moved

**Trigger**: "Run the Strategic Advisor" or "Challenge strategy"

### 👥 The Stakeholder Advocate
**Role**: Multi-Perspective Review & Audience Alignment
**Focus**: Ensure messaging resonates with each stakeholder group
**Trigger**: "Run the Stakeholder Advocate" or "Review stakeholder fit"

## Using the System

### Simple Trigger Commands

Just say any of these to an AI assistant:

```
"Run the Janitor"           → Analyze file organization
"Execute tasks"             → Complete queued tasks
"Check vault health"        → Get health summary across all personas
"Run the Curator"           → Analyze content quality
```

See [PROMPT_REFERENCE.md](PROMPT_REFERENCE.md) for complete command list.

### Workflow

#### Phase 1: Analysis
Each persona examines the vault from their perspective and documents findings.

#### Phase 2: Task Creation
Based on analysis, personas create specific, actionable tasks in the task queue.

#### Phase 3: Review & Prioritization
Tasks are reviewed and prioritized before execution.

#### Phase 4: Execution
Another AI agent executes the approved tasks.

#### Phase 5: Verification
The relevant persona verifies the completed work.

## For AI Assistants

**When user triggers a persona:**

1. ✓ Immediately read persona file from `personas/[persona].md`
2. ✓ Load state file from `state/[persona]_state.md`
3. ✓ Follow the persona's analysis checklist systematically
4. ✓ Create task files for issues found
5. ✓ Calculate and report health score
6. ✓ Update state file with findings

**Full execution guide:** [AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDE.md](AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDE.md)

## For Humans

### Review & Prioritize
1. Check `tasks/queue/` for pending tasks
2. Move critical tasks to `tasks/priority/`
3. Assign tasks to AI for execution

### Monitor Progress
- Check state files for current health scores
- Review completed tasks
- Track improvements over time

## Task Management

```
tasks/
├── queue/         # New tasks awaiting review
├── priority/      # High-priority tasks
├── in-progress/   # Currently being worked on
├── completed/     # Finished tasks
└── archived/      # Historical tasks
```

## State Tracking

Each persona maintains a state file with:
- Last analysis timestamp
- Findings summary
- Current health score (0-100)
- Identified issues
- Recommended actions
- Next analysis schedule

**View all states:** Read all files in `state/` directory

## Integration with Vault

This maintenance system:
- Works alongside Git version control
- Respects established directory structure
- Uses existing templates from `_templates/`
- Coordinates with process tracking in `_process/`
- Maintains changelog and version history

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Cadence**: Run analyses weekly or after major changes
2. **Full Coverage**: Rotate through all personas periodically
3. **Task Review**: Review tasks before execution
4. **Document Decisions**: Update state files with reasoning
5. **Coordinate Changes**: Consider impact on other personas' domains

## Quick Examples

### Example 1: First Time Use
```
User: "Run the Janitor"
AI: [Loads persona, analyzes vault, creates tasks, reports findings]
User: "Execute high priority tasks"
AI: [Completes tasks, reports results]
```

### Example 2: Regular Maintenance
```
User: "Check vault health"
AI: [Summarizes all persona health scores and issues]
User: "Run the Curator"
AI: [Analyzes content quality, creates improvement tasks]
```

### Example 3: Pre-Release Check
```
User: "Run all personas"
AI: [Runs complete baseline analysis across all 6 personas]
User: "Execute critical and high priority tasks"
AI: [Completes urgent improvements]
```
