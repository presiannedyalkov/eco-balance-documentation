## 5. Decision Points & Branching Paths

### Decision 1: Funding Source Mix
**When**: Week 1-2
**Options**:
1. **Heavy Friends/Family** (€15k+ target from personal network)

**Recommended**: Balanced mix for speed + sustainability
**Criteria**: Network size, grant landscape, timeline urgency

---

### Decision 2: Crowdfunding - Yes or No?
**When**: Week 8-9
**Question**: Should we run public crowdfunding campaign?
**Criteria**:
- Have we already raised €15k+ from friends/family? (if yes, maybe skip)

**Recommendation**: Skip if friends/family very successful (€15k+); otherwise proceed

---

### Decision 3: Deal Terms for Larger Investors

**Options**:
1. **Pure Donation** (no repayment or equity)
2. **Loan** (repayment terms, interest rate)
3. **Revenue Share** (% of future revenues)
4. **Convertible Note** (loan converts to equity if applicable)
5. **Future Equity** (equity if we become for-profit)

**Recommended**: Pure donation or low-interest loan initially
**Criteria**: Investor expectations, organizational goals, future plans

### Pitch Email Template (Friends/Family)

**Subject**: [Personal Name], I'm starting something and wanted you to be among the first to know

Hi [Name],

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to share something I'm really excited about with you.

After [brief context of why this matters to you], I'm starting Eco Balance - a non-profit dedicated to ecosystem restoration in Portugal. We're starting with 1 hectare of degraded land and will demonstrate that restoration is affordable, scalable, and impactful.

I'm reaching out because I know you care about [environment/climate/nature] and wanted to invite you to be one of our first supporters. We're raising €20-30k to cover land acquisition and our first year of restoration work.

Would you be willing to contribute [€X amount]? Any amount helps, but [€X] would specifically fund [what their money would do - e.g., "plant 100 native trees" or "cover site assessment costs"].

You can donate easily here: [link]

Even if you can't contribute right now, I'd love to keep you updated on our progress. This is just the beginning!

Thank you for reading, and for being someone I thought of when starting this journey.

Best,
[Your name]

## 7. Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

### Pitfall 1: Not Asking Early Enough
**Problem**: Waiting too long to start fundraising, creating cash flow crisis
**Warning Signs**: Land opportunity appears but no funds, delayed organizational setup
**Prevention**: Start fundraising immediately, parallel to org formation
**Recovery**: Emergency ask to close network, short-term loan, scale back initial plans

### Pitfall 2: Unclear Value Proposition
**Problem**: Can't articulate why someone should fund you vs other causes
**Warning Signs**: Confused questions, low response rate, generic rejections
**Prevention**: Test pitch with friends, get feedback, refine messaging
**Recovery**: Go back to drawing board, clarify unique value, re-approach

### Pitfall 3: Asking for Too Much or Too Little
**Problem**: Ask doesn't match donor capacity or project needs
**Warning Signs**: Sticker shock, donors giving less than hoped, insufficient funds
**Prevention**: Research typical giving levels, create tiered ask amounts, match ask to relationship
**Recovery**: Adjust ask levels, create more targeted segments

### Pitfall 4: Poor Follow-up
**Problem**: Losing commitments due to lack of follow-through
**Warning Signs**: "I'll think about it" never followed up, commitments not converted to donations
**Prevention**: Systematic tracking, calendar reminders, persistence without annoyance
**Recovery**: Re-engage with progress update, make it easy to say yes

### Pitfall 5: Donor Fatigue
**Problem**: Asking same people repeatedly without relationship building
**Warning Signs**: Declining response rates, annoyance, unsubscribes
**Prevention**: Balance asks with updates and engagement, vary communication
**Recovery**: Pull back, focus on stewardship, only ask when truly meaningful

### Pitfall 6: All Eggs in One Basket
**Problem**: Depending on single large funder who falls through
**Warning Signs**: Over-optimism about one grant/donor, lack of pipeline diversity
**Prevention**: Always have 3+ active funding sources, assume 50% will fail
**Recovery**: Accelerate other sources immediately, extend timeline if needed
