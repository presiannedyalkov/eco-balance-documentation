## 4. Step-by-Step Process (Weekly Breakdown)

### Week 1-2: Site Selection Criteria & Research

**Goal**: Define what you're looking for and where

**Actions**:
- [ ] Define site selection criteria (see scoring system below)
- [ ] Identify target regions in Portugal (based on climate, accessibility, cost)
- [ ] Research property listings (real estate sites, local agents, word of mouth)
- [ ] Create property tracking spreadsheet
- [ ] Understand local land prices (€/m² or €/ha by region)
- [ ] Research legal requirements for land purchase/lease
- [ ] Network for property leads (farmers, NGOs, municipalities)

**Site Selection Criteria** (score each 1-5):

| Criterion | Weight | Why Important |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **Degradation Level** | High | Needs restoration but not impossible |
| **Water Availability** | High | Critical for plant survival |
| **Accessibility** | High | Regular visits needed |
| **Size** | Medium | ~1 ha target (±20% OK) |
| **Soil Quality** | Medium | Must support vegetation |
| **Biodiversity Potential** | Medium | Native species can thrive |
| **Cost** | High | Must fit budget |
| **Expansion Potential** | Low | Adjacent land for future growth |
| **Community Relations** | Medium | Local support helpful |
| **Regulatory Constraints** | Medium | Avoid protected/restricted areas |

**Degradation Sweet Spot**:
- **Too Healthy**: Not degraded, expensive, may not qualify for restoration funding
- **Ideal**: Degraded from agriculture, grazing, or abandonment; restorable with effort
- **Too Degraded**: Contaminated, eroded, or requiring major remediation (too expensive)

**Deliverables**:
- Site selection criteria scorecard
- Target region list (3-5 regions)
- Property tracking spreadsheet (20-30 properties identified)
- Understanding of local market prices

**Time Commitment**: 10-15 hours

**Decision Point**:
**Question**: Which regions to focus on?
**Criteria**:
- Accessibility (within 1-2 hours of where you live/will live)
- Climate suitable for restoration goals
- Land prices (affordable range)
- Community receptiveness
- Ecosystem type match (forest, shrubland, grassland)

**Recommended Regions** (examples for Portugal):
- Alentejo: Affordable, degraded agricultural land available
- Interior Centro: Abandoned land, lower prices
- Interior Norte: Mountainous, reforestation potential
- Coastal plains: More expensive but accessible

## 5. Decision Points & Branching Paths

### Decision 1: Purchase vs. Lease
**When**: Week 9-10 (or earlier if clear preference)
**Options**:
1. **Purchase** (€8-15k upfront)

## 7. Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

### Pitfall 1: Falling in Love Too Soon
**Problem**: Emotionally committing to first property, overlooking flaws
**Warning Signs**: Skipping other site visits, ignoring red flags, overpaying
**Prevention**: Visit minimum 5 properties, use objective scorecard, sleep on decisions
**Recovery**: Walk away if due diligence reveals issues, accept sunk costs of research

### Pitfall 2: Inadequate Water Assessment
**Problem**: Underestimating water needs or development costs
**Warning Signs**: "Rain will be enough", vague water sources, no water testing
**Prevention**: Assess water critically, estimate development costs (wells €2-5k+), ensure year-round availability
**Recovery**: Budget for water development, adjust restoration plan, worst case find new property

### Pitfall 3: Hidden Access Issues
**Problem**: Access not legally secured or impassable in wet season
**Warning Signs**: Informal access, no written easement, rough roads not tested in rain
**Prevention**: Verify legal access, visit in different seasons/weather, ensure year-round usability
**Recovery**: Negotiate access easement, improve roads, or reconsider property

### Pitfall 4: Overpaying Due to Limited Options
**Problem**: Paying above fair market value because few properties available
**Warning Signs**: Accepting asking price immediately, not researching comps, desperation
**Prevention**: Research comparable sales, get multiple options, be patient, know walk-away price
**Recovery**: Accept slight overpay if property truly perfect, or restart search

### Pitfall 5: Unclear Property Boundaries
**Problem**: Buying land with disputed or unclear boundaries
**Warning Signs**: No survey, "approximate" size, neighbor disputes
**Prevention**: Get professional survey, verify in property registry, walk boundaries with owner
**Recovery**: Renegotiate price, resolve disputes pre-purchase, or walk away

### Pitfall 6: Ignoring Soil Quality
**Problem**: Land too degraded or contaminated to restore affordably
**Warning Signs**: Skipping soil testing, assuming soil is fine, visible severe erosion
**Prevention**: Test soil (texture, pH, contamination if concerns), assess realistically
**Recovery**: Adjust restoration approach (more soil building), or find different property

### Pitfall 7: Lease Terms Too Short or Restrictive
**Problem**: Lease doesn't allow enough time or flexibility for restoration
**Warning Signs**: 1-2 year lease, "no modifications" clauses, easy termination
**Prevention**: Negotiate 5+ year lease, ensure planting/modification rights, renewal options
**Recovery**: Renegotiate terms, add protections, or choose purchase instead
