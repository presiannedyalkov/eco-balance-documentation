# Convert Executive Summary to v2.0 Bootstrap Model

## Description

The Executive Summary (01_Executive_Summary.md) currently presents the v1.0 Large-Scale model assumptions, creating a **critical contradiction** with the v2.0 Bootstrap Model that was adopted on 2025-11-06. This is the first strategic document users read after the Hub, so incorrect expectations here undermine the entire vault.

## Current State

**Document**: 01_Executive_Summary.md  
**Current Model**: v1.0 Large-Scale  
**Key Contradictions**:
- States "€250,000 - €500,000" initial capital (Line ~47)
- References "5-10 hectares" for Year 1 land (Line ~39)
- Mentions "atmospheric water generation" technology (Line ~23)
- References multi-phase expansion with large teams
- Scale assumptions incompatible with v2.0

## Desired State

**Target Model**: v2.0 Bootstrap  
**Aligned Figures**:
- €20-30k Year 1 initial capital (total €50-75k)
- 1 hectare pilot site
- DIY-friendly technology (3-5 kW solar, rainwater harvesting)
- 1-2 person founder team
- Proof-of-concept before scaling approach

## Action Required

### Step 1: Read Reference Documents
1. Read 21_Technology_Integration.md (v2.0 compliant) for tech specs
2. Read 30_Business_Model.md (v2.0 compliant) for budget figures
3. Read 32_Funding_Strategy.md (v2.0 compliant) for funding approach
4. Read 42_Next_Steps_90_Days.md (v2.0 compliant) for immediate actions
5. Read 45_Tiny_House_and_Living_Infrastructure.md for living setup

### Step 2: Update Key Sections

**Investment Ask Section (Primary Update)**:
```markdown
## Investment Ask (Phase 1: Bootstrap Launch)

**Year 1 Capital Required:** €20,000 - €30,000

**Primary Use:**
- Land lease/acquisition (1 hectare pilot)
- Off-grid infrastructure (solar, water, tiny house)
- Essential restoration supplies
- Minimal operational costs

**Year 2-3 Growth:** €30,000 - €45,000 additional
**Total Bootstrap Budget:** €50,000 - €75,000

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Proven restoration methodology
- Demonstrated financial viability
- Replicable model documented
- Path to expansion validated

→ Financial details in [[30_Business_Model|Business Model]]  
→ Funding approach in [[32_Funding_Strategy|Funding Strategy]]
```

**Strategic Objectives Section (Update Timeline)**:
```markdown
## Strategic Objectives (Bootstrap Approach)

### Year 1: Prove Concept (Bootstrap Launch)
- Establish legal entity (gGmbH)
- Secure 1 hectare pilot site
- Build off-grid living infrastructure
- Launch crowdfunding campaign
- Begin restoration work

### Years 2-3: Demonstrate Impact & Refine
- Measurable ecological improvements on 1 ha
- Financial sustainability model proven
- Documentation and case studies complete
- Prepare for expansion

### Years 4-5: Scale Operations
- Expand to 5-10 hectares
- Multiple projects or sites
- Team growth begins

### Years 6-10: Regional & Global Expansion
- Policy influence achieved
- 100+ hectares managed
- Model replicated by others
- 10,000+ hectare vision progresses

→ Details in [[42_Next_Steps_90_Days|Next 90 Days]]  
→ Expansion in [[40_Expansion_Growth_Strategy|Expansion Strategy]]
```

**Key Differentiators Section (Update Technology)**:
```markdown
### 🔬 Technology Integration
Bootstrap-appropriate off-grid technology:
- 3-5 kW solar system (€8-15k)
- Rainwater harvesting with IBC tanks (€500-1k)
- Essential monitoring tools (€500-1k)
- DIY-first, maintainable approach

→ See [[21_Technology_Integration|Technology Integration]]  
→ Living setup in [[45_Tiny_House_and_Living_Infrastructure|Tiny House Infrastructure]]
```

**Update or Clarify**:
- ✅ Keep "atmospheric water generation" in **Vision layer** (clearly separated from bootstrap reality)
- ✅ Add "Vision, Reality & Planning" three-layer framework
- ✅ Update "5-10 hectares" to "1 hectare pilot" in planning, keep expansion in vision
- ✅ Add "bootstrap approach" framing
- ✅ Emphasize "prove before scale" philosophy
- ✅ Include long-term aspirations (AWG, wildlife reservoirs, food forests) as vision items

### Step 3: Fix Cross-References (Related Task)
See CUR-2025-11-07-002 for broken link fixes

### Step 4: Verify Consistency
- Check all budget figures align with v2.0 docs
- Ensure scale assumptions consistent
- Verify technology specs match 21_Technology_Integration.md
- Confirm timeline realistic for bootstrap approach

## Impact

**Why This Is CRITICAL:**
- ✅ First strategic document users read after Hub
- ✅ Sets expectations for entire project
- ✅ Currently contradicts v2.0 model (breaks trust)
- ✅ Affects funding conversations
- ✅ Influences realistic planning

**Benefits of Fixing:**
- Consistent messaging throughout vault
- Realistic expectations set from start
- Credibility restored
- Bootstrap approach clearly communicated
- Funding conversations aligned with reality

## Affected Files

**Primary:**
- 01_Executive_Summary.md

**Reference (for alignment):**
- 21_Technology_Integration.md (v2.0 ✅)
- 30_Business_Model.md (v2.0 ✅)
- 32_Funding_Strategy.md (v2.0 ✅)
- 42_Next_Steps_90_Days.md (v2.0 ✅)
- 45_Tiny_House_and_Living_Infrastructure.md (v2.0 ✅)

## Related Documents

**Other Docs Likely Needing Conversion:**
- 02_Project_Vision.md
- 03_Success_Factors.md
- 04_Current_Status_Assessment.md
- 10-13 (Organizational docs)
- 40_Expansion_Growth_Strategy.md
- 50_Risk_Assessment.md
- 51_Key_Performance_Indicators.md
- 60_Marketing_Communications_Strategy.md
- 70_Case_Studies_Restoration_Examples.md

## Estimated Effort

**MODERATE** (2-3 hours)

- Read reference docs: 45 minutes
- Draft updated sections: 60 minutes
- Review and refine: 30 minutes
- Verify consistency: 15 minutes

## Verification Criteria

Task complete when:
- [ ] All budget figures reference v2.0 Bootstrap Model
- [ ] All scale assumptions (land, team, timeline) aligned with v2.0
- [ ] Technology references match 21_Technology_Integration.md
- [x] "Atmospheric water generation" included in Vision layer (clearly separated from bootstrap plan)
- [ ] "Bootstrap approach" philosophy clearly communicated
- [ ] Cross-references point to correct v2.0-compliant docs
- [ ] Strategic objectives reflect realistic bootstrap timeline
- [ ] Investment ask shows €20-30k Year 1 (€50-75k total)
- [ ] Document reads cohesively with updated Hub

## Notes

**Why This Happened:**
- Bootstrap Model conversion (v1.0 → v2.0) completed on 2025-11-06
- 8 core documents converted in Phases 1 & 2
- Executive Summary not included in initial conversion
- Natural that first strategic docs need updating next

**Conversion Priority:**
This is THE most important document to convert because it's the first strategic content users see. The Hub announces v2.0, so Executive Summary must align immediately.

**Template for Other Conversions:**
This task can serve as template for converting remaining strategic documents (02, 03, 04, 10-13, 40, 50, 51, 60, 70).

**Priority**: CRITICAL - Execute before other Curator tasks  
**Coordination**: Update Auditor when complete (will affect consistency checks)
