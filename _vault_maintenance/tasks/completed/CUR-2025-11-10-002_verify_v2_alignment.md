# Verify v2.0 Bootstrap Model Alignment in Remaining Strategic Documents

## Description

Some strategic documents (02-04, 10-13, 40, 50-51, 60, 70) may need verification to ensure they align with v2.0 Bootstrap Model terminology and concepts. While documents are functional, they may contain v1.0 Large-Scale Model references that should be updated for consistency.

## Current State

**Documents Known v2.0 Compliant**: ✅
- 01_Executive_Summary.md (converted 2025-11-10)
- 20_Restoration_Methodology.md
- 21_Technology_Integration.md
- 30_Business_Model.md
- 32_Funding_Strategy.md
- 42_Adaptive_Timeline.md
- 43_Operations_Action_Plan.md
- 44_Site_Selection_Land_Acquisition.md
- 45_Tiny_House_and_Living_Infrastructure.md

**Documents Needing Verification**: ❓
- 02_Project_Vision.md
- 03_Success_Factors.md
- 04_Current_Status_Assessment.md
- 10_Organizational_Structure.md
- 11_Governance.md
- 12_Team_Roles.md
- 13_Legal_Framework.md
- 40_Expansion_Growth_Strategy.md
- 50_Risk_Assessment.md
- 51_Key_Performance_Indicators.md
- 60_Marketing_Communications_Strategy.md
- 70_Case_Studies_Restoration_Examples.md

**Impact**: Low - documents are functional, but terminology consistency would improve coherence

## Desired State

All strategic documents should:
- Use Bootstrap Model terminology consistently
- Reference appropriate scale (1 ha pilot, €20-30k Year 1, 1-2 founders)
- Use adaptive language ("approximately", "varies by", "depends on")
- Align with v2.0 Bootstrap Model philosophy

## Action Required

**Split into subtasks by document group** (following task splitting guidelines):

### CUR-2025-11-10-002a: Verify core strategy docs (3 files)
- 02_Project_Vision.md
- 03_Success_Factors.md
- 04_Current_Status_Assessment.md

### CUR-2025-11-10-002b: Verify organizational docs (4 files)
- 10_Organizational_Structure.md
- 11_Governance.md
- 12_Team_Roles.md
- 13_Legal_Framework.md

### CUR-2025-11-10-002c: Verify remaining docs (4 files)
- 40_Expansion_Growth_Strategy.md
- 50_Risk_Assessment.md
- 51_Key_Performance_Indicators.md
- 60_Marketing_Communications_Strategy.md
- 70_Case_Studies_Restoration_Examples.md

**For each file:**
1. Review for v1.0 Large-Scale Model references
2. Check for scale assumptions (10-30 ha, €500k-2M, 20-100 people)
3. Verify terminology (Bootstrap Model vs Large-Scale Model)
4. Check for adaptive language usage
5. Update if needed to align with v2.0 Bootstrap Model

## Impact

- ✅ Consistent terminology across all documents
- ✅ Improved coherence and clarity
- ✅ Better alignment with v2.0 Bootstrap Model
- ✅ Reduced confusion about project scale

## Affected Files

**Approximately 11 strategic documents** needing verification:
- 02_Project_Vision.md
- 03_Success_Factors.md
- 04_Current_Status_Assessment.md
- 10_Organizational_Structure.md
- 11_Governance.md
- 12_Team_Roles.md
- 13_Legal_Framework.md
- 40_Expansion_Growth_Strategy.md
- 50_Risk_Assessment.md
- 51_Key_Performance_Indicators.md
- 60_Marketing_Communications_Strategy.md
- 70_Case_Studies_Restoration_Examples.md

## Verification Criteria

- [ ] All documents reviewed for v2.0 alignment
- [ ] Terminology is consistent (Bootstrap Model)
- [ ] Scale references align with v2.0 (1 ha pilot, €20-30k Year 1)
- [ ] Adaptive language used appropriately
- [ ] No v1.0 Large-Scale Model contradictions remain

## Estimated Effort

**MODERATE** - Requires reviewing ~11 documents, but may not need changes if already aligned

## Notes

This is a verification task - documents may already be aligned. Priority is MEDIUM because documents are functional, but consistency would improve coherence. Can be done incrementally by document group.
