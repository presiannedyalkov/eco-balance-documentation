# Clarify Scientific Grounding as Core Vision Element

## Description

The core vision includes scientific grounding: "firmly grounded in science and scientific principles, strong ties to university and other types of climate science, measure how the land is doing under our guardianship when implementing approved plan with measures." This is mentioned in the documentation but not clearly stated as a core vision element. It should be clearly expressed as part of the immutable core vision.

## Current State

**Files Affected**: `02_Project_Vision.md`, `01_Executive_Summary.md`

**Current Issues**:
- Scientific grounding mentioned but not as core vision
- "Science-based methods" mentioned but not clearly as core vision element
- Missing: "firmly grounded in science and scientific principles"
- Missing: "strong ties to university and other types of climate science"
- Missing: "measure how the land is doing under our guardianship when implementing approved plan with measures"

**Current Text**:
- "Science-based methods" (mentioned)
- "Evidence-based" (mentioned)
- "Measurable impact" (mentioned)
- But not clearly stated as core vision element

## Desired State

Clear statement of scientific grounding as core vision element:

**Scientific Grounding Statement** (to be added):
> **Scientific Grounding** (Core Vision Element):
> 
> This project is **firmly grounded in science and scientific principles**. We maintain **strong ties to universities and other types of climate science** institutions. We **measure how the land is doing under our guardianship** when implementing approved plans with measures. Scientific rigor and measurement are core to our approach, not optional add-ons.

**Key Elements to Include**:
1. **Firmly grounded in science and scientific principles**
2. **Strong ties to university and other types of climate science**
3. **Measure how the land is doing under our guardianship**
4. **When implementing approved plan with measures**
5. **Clear statement** that this is a core vision element

## Action Required

1. **Add to `02_Project_Vision.md`**:
   - Add to core vision section
   - Include scientific grounding statement
   - Connect to "Scientific Foundation" section if it exists
   - Ensure it's marked as core vision element

2. **Add to `01_Executive_Summary.md`**:
   - Add to "Project Vision" section
   - Include scientific grounding as core vision element
   - Connect to core vision statement
   - Ensure prominence

3. **Ensure clarity**:
   - State that scientific grounding is part of core vision
   - Mention university ties and climate science connections
   - Emphasize measurement and guardianship
   - Connect to approved plans and measures

## Impact

- ✅ Scientific grounding clearly stated as core vision
- ✅ University ties and climate science connections emphasized
- ✅ Measurement and guardianship clearly expressed
- ✅ Scientific rigor as core, not optional
- ⚠️ **HIGH** - Core vision element needs clarity

## Affected Files

- `02_Project_Vision.md` (add scientific grounding to core vision)
- `01_Executive_Summary.md` (add to vision section)

## Verification Criteria

- [ ] Scientific grounding stated as core vision element
- [ ] "Firmly grounded in science and scientific principles" included
- [ ] "Strong ties to university and other types of climate science" included
- [ ] "Measure how the land is doing under our guardianship" included
- [ ] "When implementing approved plan with measures" included
- [ ] Clear connection to core vision

## Estimated Effort

**MINOR** - Need to add scientific grounding statement to vision sections

## Notes

- Scientific grounding is a core vision element, not just a method
- University ties and climate science connections are part of the vision
- Measurement and guardianship are core to the approach
- This distinguishes the project as science-based, not just restoration-based
