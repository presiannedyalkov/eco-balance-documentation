# Coordinate Core Vision Integration with Vision Guardian

## Description

The Vision Guardian has identified core vision elements that need to be clearly stated in key strategic documents (VGN-2025-11-11-001 to VGN-2025-11-11-004). The Curator should coordinate to ensure that core vision integration maintains content coherence, enhances cross-references appropriately, and preserves narrative flow. This is a coordination task to work with Vision Guardian tasks, not a duplicate.

## Current State

**Vision Guardian Tasks**:
- VGN-2025-11-11-001 (CRITICAL): Add core vision statement to key documents
- VGN-2025-11-11-002 (HIGH): Add UN Charter/Paris 2015 biodiversity focus
- VGN-2025-11-11-003 (HIGH): Clarify scientific grounding as core vision element
- VGN-2025-11-11-004 (HIGH): Add local integration opportunities as core vision element

**Curator Assessment**:
- Executive Summary and Project Vision mention vision elements but don't clearly state immutable core vision
- Cross-references are functional but could be enhanced after core vision is integrated
- Content coherence is good but needs verification after vision changes
- Narrative flow is excellent and should be preserved

**Impact**: 
- Medium - Coordination ensures content coherence is maintained
- Cross-references can be enhanced after vision integration
- Narrative flow should be verified after changes

## Desired State

After Vision Guardian tasks complete:
- Core vision clearly stated in key documents
- Cross-references enhanced to link to core vision
- Content coherence maintained
- Narrative flow preserved
- Terminology consistent

## Action Required

1. **Review Vision Guardian tasks** (VGN-2025-11-11-001 to VGN-2025-11-11-004)
2. **Coordinate with Vision Guardian** to ensure:
   - Core vision integration maintains content coherence
   - Cross-references are enhanced appropriately
   - Narrative flow is preserved
   - Terminology remains consistent
3. **Plan cross-reference enhancements** after core vision is integrated:
   - Add links to core vision from related documents
   - Ensure bidirectional linking where appropriate
   - Verify cross-references remain functional
4. **Verify content coherence** after vision changes:
   - Check terminology consistency
   - Verify no contradictions introduced
   - Ensure narrative flow maintained
5. **Document coordination** in state file

## Impact

- ✅ Content coherence maintained during core vision integration
- ✅ Cross-references enhanced appropriately
- ✅ Narrative flow preserved
- ✅ Terminology consistent
- ⚠️ **MEDIUM** - Coordination task to ensure quality

## Affected Files

- Coordination task - no direct file changes
- Will enhance cross-references after Vision Guardian tasks complete
- Will verify content coherence after vision changes

## Verification Criteria

- [ ] Vision Guardian tasks reviewed
- [ ] Coordination plan documented
- [ ] Cross-reference enhancements planned
- [ ] Content coherence verification planned
- [ ] Narrative flow preservation verified

## Estimated Effort

**MINOR** - Coordination and planning task (30-60 minutes)

## Notes

This is a coordination task to work with Vision Guardian tasks, not a duplicate. The Curator should coordinate to ensure content coherence is maintained during core vision integration. Cross-references should be enhanced after core vision is integrated, and content coherence should be verified after vision changes.
