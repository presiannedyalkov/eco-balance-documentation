# Update Archive README Verification Date

## Description

The archive README (`archive/README.md`) contains an outdated "Last Verified" date (October 25, 2025), suggesting the archive hasn't been verified recently. This should be updated to reflect current verification status.

## Current State

**File Affected**: `archive/README.md` (line 182)

**Current Text**:
```markdown
**Last Verified:** October 25, 2025
```

**Issue**: Date is outdated (should be November 2025)

**Context**: This appears in the "Archive Integrity" section, which tracks when the archive was last verified.

**Impact**: 
- Suggests archive hasn't been verified recently
- Minor maintenance issue
- Low priority cosmetic improvement

## Desired State

Update verification date to current:

```markdown
**Last Verified:** November 11, 2025
```

## Action Required

1. **Open** `archive/README.md`
2. **Locate** line 182 (in "Archive Integrity" section)
3. **Update** date from "October 25, 2025" to "November 11, 2025"
4. **Verify** date format is consistent with other dates in document

## Impact

- ✅ Archive verification status current
- ✅ Better maintenance tracking
- ✅ Professional presentation
- ⚠️ **LOW** - Cosmetic improvement

## Affected Files

- `archive/README.md` (single file, single line)

## Verification Criteria

- [ ] Verification date updated to November 11, 2025
- [ ] Date format consistent with other dates
- [ ] Archive integrity section reflects current status

## Estimated Effort

**TRIVIAL** - Simple date update (1 minute)

## Notes

This is a low-priority maintenance improvement. The archive verification date should reflect recent verification to maintain professional presentation and accurate maintenance tracking.
