# Verify Geographic Location Consistency Across Documents

## Description

The roadmap lists "Geographic location ambiguity (Germany vs. Southern Europe)" as blocker #2. While this is an intentional pending decision (Month 4-6), all documents should consistently reflect that location is TBD and use adaptive framework language. This task verifies consistency rather than resolving the decision.

## Current State

- **Roadmap**: Lists location ambiguity as blocker #2 (intentional pending decision)
- **Executive Summary**: States "Flexible across Europe (Germany baseline, Portugal strong candidate, open to opportunities) → Decision by Month 6"
- **Project Vision**: Lists multiple countries, states location depends on opportunities
- **Status**: Location is intentionally TBD, but consistency of messaging should be verified

## Desired State

All documents should consistently:
- State that location is TBD/pending decision
- Reference Month 4-6 decision timeline (or "when opportunity emerges")
- Use adaptive framework language ("depends on", "varies by", "TBD based on")
- Avoid claiming a specific location has been decided (unless decision is made)

## Action Required

1. **Review all strategic documents** for location references:
   - Check for any claims that location is decided
   - Verify consistent use of "TBD", "pending", "flexible" language
   - Ensure Month 4-6 timeline is referenced consistently
   - Verify adaptive framework language is used

2. **Check for contradictions**:
   - Documents claiming Germany is decided vs. documents saying TBD
   - Documents claiming Portugal is decided vs. documents saying TBD
   - Timeline inconsistencies (Month 4-6 vs. other timelines)

3. **Update if needed**:
   - Standardize location language to "TBD, decision Month 4-6"
   - Ensure all documents use adaptive framework language
   - Remove any premature location claims

4. **Document findings**:
   - List any inconsistencies found
   - Note if all documents are already consistent
   - Update roadmap blocker status if appropriate

## Impact

- ✅ Consistent messaging about location decision status
- ✅ Clear understanding that location is intentionally pending
- ✅ Adaptive framework language used consistently
- ✅ No premature location claims

## Affected Files

**To be determined during review** - Likely strategic documents (01-04, 10-13, 20-22, 30-32, 40-44, 50-51, 60, 70)

## Verification Data

**Current Location References**:
- Executive Summary: "Flexible across Europe (Germany baseline, Portugal strong candidate, open to opportunities) → Decision by Month 6"
- Project Vision: Lists multiple countries, states location depends on opportunities
- Roadmap: Lists location ambiguity as blocker #2

**Expected Pattern**:
- "Location: TBD, decision Month 4-6" or similar
- "Depends on opportunities" or "varies by location"
- No claims of specific location decision

## Verification Criteria

- [ ] All documents reviewed for location references
- [ ] No documents claim location is decided (unless decision actually made)
- [ ] Consistent use of "TBD", "pending", "flexible" language
- [ ] Month 4-6 timeline referenced consistently
- [ ] Adaptive framework language used
- [ ] Roadmap blocker status accurate

## Estimated Effort

**MINOR** - Review and verification task, may not require changes if already consistent

## Notes

This is a verification task, not a decision task. The location decision itself remains pending (Month 4-6). This task ensures all documents consistently reflect that status. Priority is MEDIUM because it's about consistency rather than resolving a critical issue.
