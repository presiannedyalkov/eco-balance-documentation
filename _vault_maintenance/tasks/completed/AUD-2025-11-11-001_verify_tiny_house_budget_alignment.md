# Verify Tiny House Budget Alignment with Total Project Budget

## Description

The 45_Tiny_House_and_Living_Infrastructure.md document contains budget information for housing and infrastructure. Previous audit rounds identified potential misalignment where housing costs alone might exceed the total project budget (€20-30k Year 1). Need to verify that budget totals in this document align with the overall Bootstrap Model budget of approximately €20-30k total Year 1.

## Current State

**File Affected**: `45_Tiny_House_and_Living_Infrastructure.md`

**Bootstrap Model Budget** (from other documents):
- Total Year 1 Budget: Approximately €20-30k (varies by funding pathway and location)
- This includes: Housing, site costs, restoration, tools, infrastructure, operations

**Potential Issue** (from previous audit rounds):
- Housing costs alone may be €15-24k
- Infrastructure costs may be €12-15k
- Total infrastructure: €36-39k
- Plus site/planting: €5-9k
- **Total: €41-48k vs €20-30k model**

**Impact**: 
- Medium - Need to verify if budget totals align
- If misaligned, creates inconsistency with Bootstrap Model
- May need clarification that housing costs are part of total budget, not additional

## Desired State

Budget totals in 45_Tiny_House_and_Living_Infrastructure.md should:
- Align with total project budget of approximately €20-30k Year 1
- Clearly indicate that housing costs are part of total budget, not additional
- Use adaptive language ("approximately", "varies by") consistent with other documents
- Match budget breakdown in 30_Business_Model.md

## Action Required

1. **Review** `45_Tiny_House_and_Living_Infrastructure.md` budget sections
2. **Compare** with `30_Business_Model.md` budget breakdown
3. **Verify** that housing costs are included in total €20-30k budget, not additional
4. **Check** for any budget totals that exceed €20-30k range
5. **Ensure** adaptive language is used consistently
6. **Clarify** if needed that housing is part of total budget, not separate

## Impact

- ✅ Budget consistency verified across all documents
- ✅ Bootstrap Model budget alignment confirmed
- ✅ No confusion about housing costs vs total budget
- ⚠️ **MEDIUM** - Verification task to ensure consistency

## Affected Files

- `45_Tiny_House_and_Living_Infrastructure.md` (verification and potential clarification)
- May need to cross-reference with `30_Business_Model.md`

## Verification Criteria

- [ ] Budget totals in 45_Tiny_House_and_Living_Infrastructure.md align with €20-30k total
- [ ] Housing costs are clearly part of total budget, not additional
- [ ] Budget breakdown matches 30_Business_Model.md
- [ ] Adaptive language used consistently
- [ ] No budget totals exceed €20-30k range without clear explanation

## Estimated Effort

**MINOR** - Verification and potential clarification (30-60 minutes)

## Notes

This is a verification task to ensure budget consistency. Previous audit rounds identified potential misalignment, but this may have been resolved. Need to verify current state and ensure alignment with Bootstrap Model budget of approximately €20-30k total Year 1.
