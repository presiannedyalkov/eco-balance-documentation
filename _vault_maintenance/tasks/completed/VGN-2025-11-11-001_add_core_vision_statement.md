# Add Core Vision Statement to Key Documents

## Description

The core vision is not clearly stated as the immutable core. The documentation needs a clear statement that the primary vision is to "create a habitat for wildlife and restore land to become a shelter and sanctuary for wildlife" with specific elements (different trees, plants, mushrooms, areas to promote different habitat, increase biodiversity). This should be clearly distinguished from operational details and planning, which can and will change.

## Current State

**Files Affected**: `02_Project_Vision.md`, `01_Executive_Summary.md`, `00_Eco_Balance_Hub.md`

**Current Issues**:
- Vision is implied but not explicitly stated
- "Wildlife habitat and sanctuary" not clearly stated as primary vision
- Vision mixed with operational details
- Not clearly distinguished as "immutable core"

**Current Text Examples**:
- "Restore degraded ecosystems to healthy, biodiverse states" (too general)
- "Biodiversity conservation" (mentioned but not as primary vision)
- Vision mixed with "how we'll get there" operational details

## Desired State

Clear, prominent statement of the immutable core vision:

**Core Vision Statement** (to be added):
> **Our Core Vision** (Immutable - This will not change):
> 
> Create a **habitat for wildlife** and **restore land to become a shelter and sanctuary for wildlife**. Through different trees, plants, mushrooms, and diverse areas, we promote different habitats and increase biodiversity. This is our primary purpose - to provide sanctuary and shelter for wildlife in the face of climate change and mass extinction.

**Key Elements to Include**:
1. **Wildlife habitat and sanctuary** as primary vision
2. **Different trees, plants, mushrooms** to promote diverse habitats
3. **Increase biodiversity** as core goal
4. **Climate change context** (manmade factors, mass extinction)
5. **Clear statement** that this is the immutable core (other documents can/will change)

## Action Required

1. **Add core vision section to `02_Project_Vision.md`**:
   - Add new section: "## Our Core Vision (Immutable)"
   - Include the core vision statement above
   - Place prominently near the top (after "The Global Challenge" section)
   - Clearly distinguish from "Vision vs Execution" section

2. **Add core vision to `01_Executive_Summary.md`**:
   - Add to "Vision Framework" section
   - Include core vision statement
   - Make it the first thing in the vision section
   - Clearly mark as "Immutable Core Vision"

3. **Add core vision to `00_Eco_Balance_Hub.md`**:
   - Add to hub page prominently
   - Include in "Project Vision" section or create dedicated "Core Vision" section
   - Ensure it's visible to first-time readers

4. **Ensure clear distinction**:
   - Mark core vision as "Immutable - This will not change"
   - Separate from operational details ("How We'll Get There")
   - Separate from planning ("Planning for Reality")
   - Make it clear this is the anchor that doesn't change

## Impact

- ✅ Core vision clearly visible and expressed
- ✅ Readers understand the immutable core purpose
- ✅ Vision distinguished from operational details
- ✅ Primary vision (wildlife habitat and sanctuary) clearly stated
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL** - Core vision must be clearly visible

## Affected Files

- `02_Project_Vision.md` (add core vision section)
- `01_Executive_Summary.md` (add to vision framework)
- `00_Eco_Balance_Hub.md` (add to hub page)

## Verification Criteria

- [ ] Core vision statement added to all three key documents
- [ ] Vision clearly states "create a habitat for wildlife and restore land to become a shelter and sanctuary for wildlife"
- [ ] Vision mentions "different trees, plants, mushrooms, diverse areas"
- [ ] Vision mentions "increase biodiversity"
- [ ] Vision clearly marked as "Immutable - This will not change"
- [ ] Vision separated from operational details
- [ ] Vision prominent and visible to first-time readers

## Estimated Effort

**MODERATE** - Need to add clear vision statements to three key documents, ensure proper placement and distinction

## Notes

- Core vision is the anchor - everything else adapts around it
- Vision should be the first thing readers see about the project's purpose
- Must be clearly distinguished from operational details and planning
- This is the immutable core that won't change, unlike other documents
