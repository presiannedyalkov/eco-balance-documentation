# Add UN Charter/Paris 2015 Biodiversity Focus to Vision

## Description

The core vision includes a focus on biodiversity from the UN Charter climate change mitigation areas (post-Paris 2015 agreement). This is a critical vision element that is completely missing from the documentation. The vision should state that from all areas listed in the UN Charter about climate change mitigation after the Paris 2015 agreement, the project prefers to concentrate on biodiversity.

## Current State

**Files Affected**: `02_Project_Vision.md`, `01_Executive_Summary.md`

**Current Issues**:
- **MISSING**: No mention of UN Charter
- **MISSING**: No mention of Paris 2015 agreement
- **MISSING**: No statement about focusing on biodiversity from climate change mitigation areas
- Climate change is mentioned, but not in context of UN Charter/Paris 2015

**Current Text**:
- Mentions "climate change" and "biodiversity" separately
- No connection to UN Charter or Paris 2015
- No statement about choosing biodiversity from climate change mitigation areas

## Desired State

Clear statement about UN Charter/Paris 2015 biodiversity focus:

**UN Charter/Paris 2015 Statement** (to be added):
> From all areas listed in the **UN Charter about climate change mitigation after the Paris 2015 agreement**, we prefer to concentrate on **biodiversity**. While climate change mitigation includes many areas (energy, transportation, agriculture, etc.), our focus is specifically on biodiversity conservation and restoration as our contribution to addressing climate change.

**Key Elements to Include**:
1. **UN Charter** reference
2. **Paris 2015 agreement** reference
3. **Climate change mitigation areas** context
4. **Biodiversity focus** as the chosen area
5. **Rationale** for choosing biodiversity

## Action Required

1. **Add to `02_Project_Vision.md`**:
   - Add to core vision section or "The Global Challenge" section
   - Include UN Charter/Paris 2015 reference
   - State biodiversity focus from climate change mitigation areas
   - Connect to climate change context

2. **Add to `01_Executive_Summary.md`**:
   - Add to "Project Vision" section
   - Include UN Charter/Paris 2015 reference
   - State biodiversity focus
   - Connect to core vision

3. **Ensure context**:
   - Explain that UN Charter lists multiple climate change mitigation areas
   - State that biodiversity is the chosen focus
   - Connect to the core vision (wildlife habitat and sanctuary)

## Impact

- ✅ UN Charter/Paris 2015 alignment clearly stated
- ✅ Biodiversity focus justified in context of climate change mitigation
- ✅ Vision grounded in international climate agreements
- ✅ Clear rationale for biodiversity focus
- ⚠️ **HIGH** - Critical vision element currently missing

## Affected Files

- `02_Project_Vision.md` (add UN Charter/Paris 2015 reference)
- `01_Executive_Summary.md` (add to vision section)

## Verification Criteria

- [ ] UN Charter mentioned
- [ ] Paris 2015 agreement mentioned
- [ ] Climate change mitigation areas context provided
- [ ] Biodiversity focus stated as chosen area
- [ ] Connection to core vision clear
- [ ] Rationale for biodiversity focus provided

## Estimated Effort

**MINOR** - Need to add UN Charter/Paris 2015 reference and biodiversity focus statement

## Notes

- This connects the project to international climate agreements
- Provides context for why biodiversity is the focus
- Grounds the vision in recognized climate change mitigation framework
- Important for credibility and alignment with global climate goals
