# Standardize Hub Back-Links in Strategic Documents

## Description

Not all strategic documents have consistent "← Back to Hub" links at the top. This creates inconsistent navigation patterns and makes it harder for users to return to the main hub page.

## Current State

- **Documents with back-link**: Most strategic documents have `**← Back to [[strategic/00_Eco_Balance_Hub|Project Hub]]**` at top
- **Documents missing back-link**: Some strategic documents lack this navigation aid
- **Inconsistent formatting**: Some variations in link text or placement
- **Impact**: Users may have difficulty returning to hub from some documents

## Desired State

All strategic documents (01-70) should have a consistent back-link at the top:
```markdown
**← Back to [[strategic/00_Eco_Balance_Hub|Project Hub]]**
```

## Action Required

1. **Audit all strategic documents** (01-70) for back-link presence
2. **Identify documents missing back-link** or with inconsistent format
3. **Add or standardize back-links** in missing/inconsistent documents
4. **Verify consistency** across all documents

**Split into subtasks if >5 files need updates** (following task splitting guidelines)

## Impact

- ✅ Consistent navigation pattern across all documents
- ✅ Easier return to hub from any document
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ Professional presentation

## Affected Files

**To be determined during audit** - Likely 3-5 strategic documents need updates

## Verification Criteria

- [ ] All strategic documents (01-70) have back-link at top
- [ ] Back-link format is consistent: `**← Back to [[strategic/00_Eco_Balance_Hub|Project Hub]]**`
- [ ] All back-links work correctly
- [ ] Navigation pattern is uniform

## Estimated Effort

**TRIVIAL to MINOR** - Simple addition/standardization

## Notes

This is a polish/consistency improvement. Not critical for functionality, but improves user experience and professional presentation.
