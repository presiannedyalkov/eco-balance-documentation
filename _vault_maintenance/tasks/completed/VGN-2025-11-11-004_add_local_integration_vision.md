# Add Local Integration Opportunities as Core Vision Element

## Description

The core vision includes local integration opportunities: "opportunities in energy sector, food sector, society and more areas by transitioning to a more local and pragmatic sources and services, integrating local knowledge into the project and alleviating actual local problems." This is mentioned in the documentation (community engagement) but not clearly stated as a core vision element. It should be clearly expressed as part of the immutable core vision.

## Current State

**Files Affected**: `02_Project_Vision.md`, `01_Executive_Summary.md`

**Current Issues**:
- Local integration mentioned but not as core vision
- "Community engagement" mentioned but not as local integration opportunities
- Missing: "opportunities in energy sector, food sector, society"
- Missing: "transitioning to local/pragmatic sources and services"
- Missing: "integrating local knowledge"
- Missing: "alleviating actual local problems"

**Current Text**:
- "Community engagement" (mentioned)
- "Community partnership" (mentioned)
- "Local employment" (mentioned)
- But not clearly stated as core vision element with specific sectors

## Desired State

Clear statement of local integration as core vision element:

**Local Integration Statement** (to be added):
> **Local Integration Opportunities** (Core Vision Element):
> 
> We see opportunities in the **energy sector, food sector, society, and more areas** by **transitioning to more local and pragmatic sources and services**, **integrating local knowledge** into the project, and **alleviating actual local problems**. This is not just community engagement - it's about creating local solutions that address real local needs while advancing our restoration goals.

**Key Elements to Include**:
1. **Opportunities in energy sector, food sector, society**
2. **Transitioning to local/pragmatic sources and services**
3. **Integrating local knowledge** into the project
4. **Alleviating actual local problems**
5. **Clear statement** that this is a core vision element

## Action Required

1. **Add to `02_Project_Vision.md`**:
   - Add to core vision section
   - Include local integration statement
   - Specify sectors (energy, food, society)
   - Connect to community engagement sections

2. **Add to `01_Executive_Summary.md`**:
   - Add to "Project Vision" section
   - Include local integration as core vision element
   - Specify sectors and opportunities
   - Connect to core vision statement

3. **Ensure clarity**:
   - State that local integration is part of core vision
   - Mention specific sectors (energy, food, society)
   - Emphasize local knowledge integration
   - Connect to alleviating local problems

## Impact

- ✅ Local integration clearly stated as core vision
- ✅ Specific sectors (energy, food, society) mentioned
- ✅ Local knowledge integration emphasized
- ✅ Connection to alleviating local problems clear
- ⚠️ **HIGH** - Core vision element needs clarity

## Affected Files

- `02_Project_Vision.md` (add local integration to core vision)
- `01_Executive_Summary.md` (add to vision section)

## Verification Criteria

- [ ] Local integration stated as core vision element
- [ ] Energy sector mentioned
- [ ] Food sector mentioned
- [ ] Society/social sector mentioned
- [ ] "Transitioning to local/pragmatic sources" included
- [ ] "Integrating local knowledge" included
- [ ] "Alleviating actual local problems" included
- [ ] Clear connection to core vision

## Estimated Effort

**MINOR** - Need to add local integration statement to vision sections

## Notes

- Local integration is a core vision element, not just community engagement
- Specific sectors (energy, food, society) are part of the vision
- Local knowledge integration is core to the approach
- This distinguishes the project as locally integrated, not just restoration-focused
