# Note: Strategic Decision Paralysis

**Created:** November 12, 2025  
**Context:** Response to Audit Summary Critical Issue #3

---

## The Point

The audit identified that **nearly every major strategic decision is marked "TBD" with no forcing functions to decide**. This creates a situation where:

1. **You cannot execute** without committed direction
2. **Decision paralysis risks** indefinite delays
3. **Opportunity costs** from perpetual planning instead of action
4. **Founder burnout** from never making progress

---

## What This Means

The documentation is excellent at **documenting options** but weak at **making decisions**. This is a common trap: over-optimization for flexibility creates inability to commit.

**The point is:** You need to **make decisions** to move forward, not just document all possible options.

---

## What's NOT the Point

- ❌ Not saying "don't be flexible"
- ❌ Not saying "don't document options"
- ❌ Not saying "make hasty decisions"

## What IS the Point

- ✅ **Make "good enough" decisions** with available information
- ✅ **Set deadlines** for decisions (forcing functions)
- ✅ **Commit to a direction** and execute
- ✅ **Document decisions** once made (not just options)

---

## The Solution

Create **forcing function decision framework** with deadlines:

1. **Location:** Decide by Month 3 (not Month 6) based on best available info
2. **Legal structure:** Must align with location, decide within 2 weeks of location
3. **Timeline:** Commit to baseline (Option B: 12-18 months) as primary path
4. **Funding:** Choose primary pathway by Month 2, pursue aggressively

**Key Principle:** "Good enough" decision made on time > "Perfect" decision made too late

---

## Action Items

- [ ] Review all "TBD" items in strategic documents
- [ ] Create decision deadlines for each major decision
- [ ] Establish "good enough" criteria (not "perfect")
- [ ] Create commitment mechanism (announce decisions publicly)
- [ ] Update documents to reflect decisions once made

---

**Bottom Line:** The documentation is ready. Now you need to **decide and execute**, not just plan.
