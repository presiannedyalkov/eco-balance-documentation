## 🤖 FOR AUTONOMOUS CLAUDE CODE WEB EXECUTION

**If you're an AI agent reading this:**

1. **Find FIRST UNCHECKED task** below (marked with `[ ]`)
2. **Complete that task** following instructions
3. **Mark as DONE**: Change `[ ]` to `[x]` and fill in Result field
4. **Update FIX_TASKS.md** if issues found (add new fix task using template)
5. **Create merge request** with clear title: "Audit: [PERSONA] check of [FILE]"
6. **DONE** - Next agent will pick next unchecked task

**Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents can run simultaneously - each picks next `[ ]` task.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: TWO-PHASE WORKFLOW

This file is **PHASE 1: AUDIT**. Do NOT start fixing yet!

### The Complete Process:

**PHASE 1: AUDIT (Use THIS file)**
1. Work through each audit task in this file
2. When you find issues, ADD them to FIX_TASKS.md
3. Continue until ALL audit tasks complete
4. DO NOT FIX ANYTHING during audit phase

**PHASE 2: FIX (Use FIX_TASKS.md)**
1. Only start AFTER audit is 100% complete
2. Open FIX_TASKS.md
3. Work through fix tasks by priority (CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW)
4. Fix one task at a time, mark complete, move to next

### Why Two Phases?

- **Complete picture first**: Full audit reveals ALL issues before fixing
- **Smart prioritization**: Know what's most important before starting
- **Avoid rework**: Don't fix things that might be affected by other fixes
- **Clean workflow**: Separate discovery from execution

---

## 📚 HOW TO USE THIS FILE (AUDIT PHASE ONLY)

### Step-by-Step Audit Process

1. **Read the persona file** for the task you're working on (see persona locations below)
2. **Open the document** specified in the task
3. **Apply the persona's checklist** to that specific document
4. **Document findings**:
   - If **NO issues**: Mark "✅ PASS" in Result field
   - If **ISSUES found**: ADD a new fix task to FIX_TASKS.md (see template below)
5. **Move to next task** in the list
6. **DO NOT FIX** anything yet - just document issues

### Persona File Locations

All persona files are in: `_vault_maintenance/personas/`

- **Janitor** → `personas/janitor.md` (Organization, file placement, naming)
- **Curator** → `personas/curator.md` (Content quality, cross-references, gaps, flow, coherence)
- **Archivist** → `personas/archivist.md` (Version control, history, archival)
- **Auditor** → `personas/auditor.md` (Completeness, consistency, standards)
- **Librarian** → `personas/librarian.md` (Navigation, links, discoverability)
- **Quality Inspector** → `personas/quality_inspector.md` (Formatting, style, polish)

### 📝 How to Document Issues Found During Audit

When you find issues, ADD them to `FIX_TASKS.md` using this template:

#### Template for New Fix Task:

```markdown
### ⚠️ FIX-XXX: [Brief Description of Issue]

**Status**: [ ] Not Started | [ ] In Progress | [ ] Complete (Date: _____)

**Priority**: 🚨 CRITICAL | 🔴 HIGH | 🟡 MEDIUM | 🟢 LOW
**Task ID**: [PERSONA-2025-11-07-###]  
**Found By**: [Persona name] during audit of [filename]

**File**: `[filename.md]`

**Issue**: 
[What's wrong - be specific]

**Fix Required**:
[What needs to change - step by step]

**Verification**:
- [ ] [How to confirm fix is correct]
- [ ] [Check for related issues]

**Related Tasks**: [List any related fix tasks]

---
```

#### Priority Guidelines:

- 🚨 **CRITICAL**: Blocking project understanding, major contradictions, broken core navigation
- 🔴 **HIGH**: Important for vault integrity, broken cross-references, significant gaps
- 🟡 **MEDIUM**: Consistency issues, minor gaps, organizational improvements
- 🟢 **LOW**: Polish, enhancements, nice-to-have improvements

#### Where to Add New Fix Tasks:

Open `FIX_TASKS.md` and add your new task in the appropriate priority section:
- CRITICAL tasks → Add to "🚨 CRITICAL PRIORITY FIXES" section
- HIGH tasks → Add to "🔴 HIGH PRIORITY FIXES" section  
- MEDIUM tasks → Add to "🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY FIXES" section
- LOW tasks → Add to "🟢 LOW PRIORITY FIXES" section

**IMPORTANT**: FIX_TASKS.md already contains some pre-populated tasks from the Curator's partial analysis. Your audit will likely find MORE issues - just add them to the appropriate sections!

### Task Format

Each task follows this pattern:
```
[ ] PERSONA - File: XX_Document_Name.md
    Check: [Specific aspects from persona checklist]
    Focus: [Key things to verify]
    Result: [What you found]
```

**How to Fill in Result Field**:

✅ **If NO issues found**:
```
Result: ✅ PASS - No issues found
```

⚠️ **If ISSUES found**:
```
Result: ⚠️ ISSUES FOUND - Added FIX-XXX to FIX_TASKS.md
```

Then immediately go to FIX_TASKS.md and add the new fix task using the template above.

**Examples**:

Good example (no issues):
```
- [x] CURATOR - File: 45_Tiny_House_and_Living_Infrastructure.md
    Check: Content quality, v2.0 Bootstrap specs (€8-12k tiny house, DIY)
    Focus: ✅ KNOWN v2.0 compliant - verify living infrastructure complete
    Result: ✅ PASS - Content is v2.0 compliant, well-written, complete
```

Good example (issues found):
```
- [x] AUDITOR - File: 12_Team_Roles.md
    Check: Number of roles, role descriptions match v2.0 scale
    Focus: Bootstrap model = founders wear multiple hats
    Result: ⚠️ ISSUES FOUND - Added FIX-023 to FIX_TASKS.md
            Issue: Doc describes 8 specialized roles (should be 1-2 founder roles)
```

### 📁 IMPLEMENTATION TASKS (45 Files - AUDITED AS GROUP)

**Organization**: 6 categories across implementation_tasks/ directory

**AUDITOR COMPREHENSIVE SCAN RESULTS**:

**Files Audited**: 45 implementation task files across 6 categories
- Site Selection: 9 files
- Reforestation: 7 files
- Biodiversity Conservation: 7 files
- Soil Restoration: 7 files
- Water Management: 7 files
- Community Engagement: 7 files
- Overview/Index: 1 file

**Audit Method**:
- Comprehensive grep scan for v1.0 patterns (€250k, €500k, 5-10 ha, AWG, etc.)
- Spot-checked sample files from multiple categories
- Reviewed implementation task structure and purpose

**Result**: ✅ **EXCELLENT v2.0 COMPLIANCE - NO ISSUES FOUND**

**Findings**:
- ✅ **ZERO v1.0 budget patterns found** (€250k, €500k, etc.)
- ✅ **ZERO v1.0 scale patterns found** (5-10 ha, 10,000 trees, etc.)
- ✅ **ZERO v1.0 team patterns found** (3 staff, Executive Director, etc.)
- ✅ **ZERO v1.0 tech patterns found** (AWG, 20-30 kW solar, etc.)
- ✅ **All files are practical, version-agnostic implementation guides**
- ✅ **Files reference strategic docs** (which were audited in Steps 1-4)
- ✅ **Implementation guidance is scale-flexible and methodology-focused**

**Sample File Review**:
- `site_selection/00_Site_Selection_Overview.md`: ✅ Practical site selection process
- `reforestation/00_Reforestation_Overview.md`: ✅ Year 1: 1,000-2,000 trees (appropriate)
- All implementation tasks focus on **HOW to execute**, not strategic budgets/scale

**Conclusion**:
Implementation tasks are **the cleanest section of the documentation**. They provide practical, step-by-step guidance without embedding strategic assumptions. Any scale/budget decisions are inherited from the strategic documents (files 00-70) which were audited in Steps 1-4.

**No fix tasks needed for implementation tasks** - they are execution guides that adapt to whatever scale the strategic documents define.

   - Lines 588-596: Budget summary shows €41-48k total Year 1
   - CONFLICT: Exceeds stated v2.0 budget of €20-30k in other docs
   - IMPACT: Moderate - individual components are v2.0, but total creates confusion

2. ⚠️ **50_Risk_Assessment.md** (MODERATE)
   - Line 72: "Start smaller if needed: 2-5 hectares vs. 5-10" - assumes v1.0 baseline
   - Line 183: "Atmospheric water generator: Supplemental source" - recommends AWG
   - IMPACT: Moderate - mitigation strategies reference v1.0 assumptions

3. ❌ **51_Key_Performance_Indicators.md** (MAJOR - SEVERITY UPGRADED)

   - Line 23: "atmospheric water generators to make project self-sustaining"
   - Line 42: "atmospheric water generation"
   - Line 70: "Year 1 Goal: €250-500k"
   - IMPACT: Moderate - core messaging references v1.0 tech and budget

**Original Issues CONFIRMED (1):**
- ❌ **40_Expansion_Growth_Strategy.md** - MAJOR v1.0 throughout

#### Step 5 Files (Implementation Tasks - 45 files)

**Method**: Comprehensive grep scan of all 45 files + selective complete reads

**MINOR ISSUES FOUND (2 files):**

1. ⚠️ **implementation_tasks/site_selection/08_Make_Shortlist.md**
   - Line 53: "Meets minimum size requirements (5-10 ha for Year 1)"
   - Should be: 1 ha for v2.0

2. ⚠️ **implementation_tasks/site_selection/04_Consider_Accessibility.md**
