## Classification Framework

Eco Balance uses a **three-tier classification system** to manage information security and access control:

1. **PUBLIC** - Safe for unrestricted public access
2. **INTERNAL** - Limited to team, advisors, and partners
3. **CONFIDENTIAL** - Restricted to founders, board, and authorized personnel only

## Classification Decision Framework

### Decision Tree

```
START: Review document/section

↓

Question 1: Does it contain credentials, bank details, or PII?
├─ YES → CONFIDENTIAL
└─ NO → Continue

↓

Question 2: Does it contain personal contact info (emails, phones, addresses)?
├─ YES → Is it generic/organizational contact info?
│   ├─ YES (info@, contact@) → PUBLIC (if otherwise appropriate)
│   └─ NO (personal emails/phones) → CONFIDENTIAL
└─ NO → Continue

↓

Question 3: Does it contain financial information?
├─ YES → Is it specific/exact amounts?
│   ├─ YES (€47,532.18) → Is it sensitive financial data?
│   │   ├─ YES (bank balance, salary) → CONFIDENTIAL
│   │   └─ NO (budget line item) → INTERNAL
│   └─ NO (ranges: €20-30k) → PUBLIC (if otherwise appropriate)
└─ NO → Continue

↓

Question 4: Does it contain partner/vendor specifics?
├─ YES → Are these publicly announced partnerships?
│   ├─ YES → PUBLIC
│   └─ NO → Are these confidential terms or unpublished commitments?
│       ├─ YES (NDA, confidential terms) → CONFIDENTIAL
│       └─ NO (negotiation details, vendor quotes) → INTERNAL
└─ NO → Continue

↓

Question 5: Does it contain detailed operational/strategic plans?
├─ YES → Does it include proprietary IP or competitive advantage?
│   ├─ YES → CONFIDENTIAL
│   └─ NO → Is it step-by-step tactical detail?
│       ├─ YES → INTERNAL
│       └─ NO (high-level overview) → PUBLIC
└─ NO → Continue

↓

Question 6: Is there any reason this shouldn't be public?
├─ YES → Could harm organization, partners, or stakeholders if disclosed?
│   ├─ YES → Is it highly sensitive?
│   │   ├─ YES → CONFIDENTIAL
│   │   └─ NO → INTERNAL
│   └─ NO → INTERNAL (default to more restrictive if uncertain)
└─ NO → PUBLIC

END
```

## Mixed-Classification Documents

### Definition
Documents containing sections or data points that fall into different classification levels.

### Handling Strategy

**Option 1: Classify by Highest Level**
- Entire document classified at highest level present
- Example: Document with mostly PUBLIC content but one CONFIDENTIAL section → CONFIDENTIAL
- **Pro**: Simple, conservative, safe
- **Con**: May over-restrict access to non-sensitive portions

**Option 2: Split Document**
- Create separate versions for different audiences
- Example:
  - `Funding_Strategy_PUBLIC.md` - Ranges, general approach
  - `Funding_Strategy_INTERNAL.md` - Specific amounts, detailed pipeline
  - `Funding_Strategy_CONFIDENTIAL.md` - Bank details, confidential terms
- **Pro**: Maximizes appropriate access
- **Con**: More maintenance, version control complexity

**Option 3: Redaction**
- Create PUBLIC version with redactions
- Keep complete version as INTERNAL or CONFIDENTIAL
- Example:
  - PUBLIC: "Bootstrap funding target: €20-30k from [REDACTED] sources"
  - INTERNAL: "Bootstrap funding target: €25k from friends/family (€15k) and crowdfunding (€10k)"
- **Pro**: Single document, clear redaction markers
- **Con**: Obvious that information is withheld

**Recommended Approach**:
- **For Documentation Vault**: Use **Option 2 (Split)** or **Option 3 (Redaction)**
- **For External Materials**: Use **Option 3 (Redaction)** with clean PUBLIC version
- **When Uncertain**: Use **Option 1 (Classify by Highest)** as safe default

```

---

## Access Control Implementation

### Technical Controls

**PUBLIC**:
- Public GitHub repository
- Public website pages
- No access restrictions
- Search engine indexed

**INTERNAL**:
- Private GitHub repository or branch
- Password-protected intranet
- Team-only access (authenticated)
- Not search engine indexed

**CONFIDENTIAL**:
- Encrypted storage (e.g., VeraCrypt, encrypted cloud)
- Strictly controlled access list
- Access logging enabled
- Two-factor authentication required
- Regular access reviews

### Physical Controls

**PUBLIC**:
- Can be printed and distributed freely
- No special storage requirements

**INTERNAL**:
- Printed copies controlled (numbered if needed)
- Stored in secure office/cabinet when not in use
- Disposed of securely (shred, not trash)

**CONFIDENTIAL**:
- Minimal printing (digital only preferred)
- Printed copies numbered and logged
- Stored in locked cabinet/safe
- Destroyed securely (cross-cut shred, witnessed destruction)

---

## Declassification & Reclassification

### When to Reclassify

**CONFIDENTIAL → INTERNAL**:
- Partnership becomes public
- Financial data becomes historical (e.g., prior year, published)
- Contract terms no longer sensitive
- Legal matter resolved and public

**INTERNAL → PUBLIC**:
- Strategy is implemented and no longer competitive advantage
- Partnership announced publicly
- Financial data published in annual report
- Information becomes public domain

**PUBLIC → INTERNAL or CONFIDENTIAL** (Rare):
- Error in initial classification (should not have been public)
- Circumstances change (partnership becomes sensitive)
- New regulation requires restricting access

### Declassification Process

1. **Review Request**: Document why declassification is appropriate
2. **Approval**: Obtain approval from document owner or security officer
3. **Update Metadata**: Change classification markings
4. **Access Control**: Update access controls if needed
5. **Notification**: Inform stakeholders of classification change
6. **Audit Trail**: Log classification change with rationale

---

## Classification Review Schedule

### Regular Reviews

- **CONFIDENTIAL Documents**: Review annually or upon significant change
- **INTERNAL Documents**: Review semi-annually or before external sharing
- **PUBLIC Documents**: Review before each publication/update

### Triggers for Ad-Hoc Review

- Before public release or publication
- Before sharing with new partner/advisor
- After partnership announcement
- After significant business change (e.g., funding round, major pivot)
- Upon request from stakeholder
- Regulatory or legal requirement change

---

## Compliance & Legal Considerations

### GDPR Compliance

**Personal Data** (GDPR Article 4):
- Any information relating to identified/identifiable person
- **Default Classification**: CONFIDENTIAL (unless consent for PUBLIC)
- Requires lawful basis, purpose limitation, data minimization

**Special Category Data** (GDPR Article 9):
- Health, biometric, genetic, political opinions, etc.
- **Classification**: ALWAYS CONFIDENTIAL
- Requires explicit consent or specific legal basis

### gGmbH Requirements (Germany)

**Public Disclosure Requirements**:
- Organization name, legal form, registration number
- Board composition (may be PUBLIC)
- Annual reports (may be PUBLIC)
- **Classification**: PUBLIC for required disclosures

**Protected Information**:
- Internal deliberations
- Board member personal details (beyond name/role)
- Financial specifics (unless required public disclosure)
- **Classification**: INTERNAL or CONFIDENTIAL as appropriate

---

## Training & Awareness

### Classification Training for Team

All team members should understand:
1. Three classification levels and definitions
2. Decision framework for classifying content
3. How to mark documents with classification
4. Access control procedures for each level
5. Consequences of misclassification or unauthorized disclosure

### Classification Awareness

- **Default to Higher Classification**: When uncertain, classify higher (more restrictive)
- **Ask Before Sharing**: If uncertain about classification, ask before sharing
- **Think Before Publishing**: Once PUBLIC, cannot be taken back
- **Protect Confidential**: Treat CONFIDENTIAL information with highest care

---

## Consequences of Misclassification

### Over-Classification (Too Restrictive)

**Risks**:
- Reduced transparency and trust
- Missed partnership opportunities
- Inefficient collaboration
- Stakeholder confusion

**Mitigation**: Regular declassification reviews

### Under-Classification (Too Permissive)

**Risks**:
- Data breach or privacy violation
- GDPR non-compliance (fines up to €20M or 4% revenue)
- Reputational damage
- Loss of competitive advantage
- Legal liability
- Partnership trust violation

**Mitigation**: Security audits, access controls, training

**Priority**: **Avoid under-classification** - consequences are severe

3. **Review Context**: Same data might be PUBLIC in one context, CONFIDENTIAL in another
4. **Check Precedent**: How have similar documents been classified?
5. **Consider Stakeholders**: Who could be harmed by disclosure?
