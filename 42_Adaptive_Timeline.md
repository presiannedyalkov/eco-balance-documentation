# Adaptive Timeline - Flexible Pathways to Launch

**← Back to [[00_Eco_Balance_Hub|Project Hub]]**

---

## 🎯 Timeline Framework Philosophy

**This is NOT a fixed plan.** The timeline will adapt based on opportunities, constraints, and circumstances as they emerge. We present multiple viable pathways to reach our goal: an operational restoration site with land, basic infrastructure, and initial planting.

**Core Principle**: Stay flexible, maintain multiple options, adapt to what materializes.

---

## Vision & Core Requirements

### Vision
Operational restoration site with:
- Land secured (purchased or leased)
- Basic infrastructure in place (shelter, power, water)
- Initial planting completed
- Community of supporters established
- Sustainable work model for founders

### Core Requirements (Non-Negotiable)
- **Founder financial security**: Maintain jobs/income until project revenue is €30-50k/year stable
- **Sustainable workload**: Not burnout-inducing (realistic hours based on life circumstances)
- **Basic milestones achieved**: Legal entity formed, land secured, initial ecological restoration begun
- **Health and safety**: Founders maintain access to healthcare, safe living conditions
- **Legal compliance**: Operating within regulatory frameworks

---

---

### Option D: Opportunity-Driven (Variable Timeline)

**Summary**: Flexible timeline that adapts to major opportunities as they emerge

**Probability**: 20-30% (unpredictable by nature)

**How It Works**:
- Start with baseline plan (Option B)
- Remain alert and responsive to opportunities
- Pivot quickly when compelling opportunity emerges
- Timeline adapts to opportunity requirements

**Example Scenarios**:

**Scenario 1: Major Grant Month 3**
- €30k grant awarded in Month 3
- **Action**: Accelerate to Fast Track from Month 4
- **New Timeline**: 6-8 months from Month 4 (total 10-11 months)
- **Changes**: Can afford better land, full infrastructure, more comfortable setup

**Scenario 2: Free Land Offered Month 6**
- Landowner offers free long-term lease or donation
- **Action**: Skip fundraising for land, redirect €10-15k to infrastructure
- **New Timeline**: 8-12 months (accelerate setup phase)
- **Changes**: Upgrade solar, water, shelter quality

**Scenario 3: University Partnership Month 5**
- University offers research partnership with funding and support

**Key Principle**: **Stay flexible, recognize opportunities, adapt quickly**

**Decision Framework for Opportunities**:
1. **Does it meet core requirements?** (security, health, legality)
2. **Is the trade-off favorable?** (what we gain vs what we give up/change)
3. **Can we execute on it?** (capacity, resources, timing)
4. **Does it align with vision?** (ecosystem restoration, sustainability)
5. **What's the urgency?** (decide within days, weeks, or months?)

**Examples of Opportunities to Watch For**:
- Grants with specific location requirements
- Land below market rate
- Partnership offers (NGOs, universities, municipalities)
- Mentorship from experienced practitioners
- Volunteer offers (skilled helpers)
- Equipment donations or discounts
- Media attention that accelerates community building

**Status**: Active mindset - Always watching for opportunities

## Factors Determining Timeline

The actual timeline will emerge based on these key factors:

### 1. Funding Speed
- **Secured in 3 months** (grant awarded, crowdfunding succeeds early) → Fast Track possible
- **Secured in 6 months** (crowdfunding campaign completes) → Gradual Build likely
- **Secured in 12+ months** (slow grant cycles, bootstrap) → Slow & Steady

### 2. Founder Work Availability
- **Can go full-time** → Fast Track (6-9 months)
- **Part-time 15-25 hr/week** → Gradual Build (12-18 months)
- **Very part-time 10-15 hr/week** → Slow & Steady (24-36 months)

### 3. Location Decision Clarity
- **Decided Month 1-2** (clear opportunity) → Enables faster execution
- **Decided Month 4-6** (after exploration) → Gradual Build timeline
- **Decided Month 6-12** (multiple factors, indecision) → Extends timeline

### 4. Land Availability
- **Perfect land found Month 1-3** → Can accelerate
- **Search takes 4-8 months** → Normal pace
- **Search takes 8-12+ months** → Extends timeline

### 5. Regulatory/Legal Speed
- **e.V. or Associação** (4-8 weeks) → Minimal delay
- **gGmbH** (3-6 months) → Adds timeline
- **Informal Year 1** (no entity) → Fastest but limited capability

### 6. Personal Circumstances
- Health, family, relationship factors
- Job security and flexibility
- Geographic mobility
- Financial cushion available

**Current Assessment**: Based on current circumstances, **Option B (12-18 months Gradual Build) is most realistic baseline**.

---

## Current Plan & Status

### Assumed Baseline: Option B (12-18 Months)

**Rationale**:
- Part-time work model is sustainable

## Triggers to Accelerate or Decelerate

### Triggers to Accelerate (B → A: Gradual to Fast Track)

**Immediate Acceleration** (can shift within weeks):
1. **Major funding secured**: €20k+ grant awarded or crowdfunding vastly exceeds target
   - **Action**: Finalize location within 2 weeks, move to full-time if possible
   - **New Timeline**: 6-9 months from acceleration point

2. **Perfect land opportunity**: Free land, very cheap land, or ideal conditions that must be secured fast
   - **Action**: Secure immediately, adapt plan around this anchor
   - **New Timeline**: 8-12 months

3. **Founder availability changes**: Sabbatical, severance, job flexibility increases
   - **Action**: Utilize time window intensively
   - **New Timeline**: Variable based on window

4. **Partnership with resources**: Organization offers support, funding, mentorship with timeline
   - **Action**: Align to their schedule, leverage resources
   - **New Timeline**: Negotiated with partner

### Triggers to Decelerate (B → C: Gradual to Slow & Steady)

**Planned Deceleration** (thoughtful adjustment):
1. **Funding slower than expected**: Crowdfunding falls short, grants rejected, need more time
   - **Action**: Shift to bootstrap model, save €500-800/month from jobs
   - **New Timeline**: 24-36 months

2. **Location decision unclear**: Multiple factors preventing decision, opportunities not materializing
   - **Action**: Extend exploration phase, use time to accumulate capital
   - **New Timeline**: Add 6-12 months to baseline

3. **Personal circumstances**: Health, family, job demands require more focus elsewhere
   - **Action**: Reduce project hours to 10-15/week, extend timeline
   - **New Timeline**: 24-36 months

4. **Want to test more thoroughly**: Prefer to validate approach before full commitment
   - **Action**: Deliberate choice of lean testing phase
   - **New Timeline**: 24-36 months with Year 1-2 as testing

### When to Pause Entirely

**Red Flags** (reassess if multiple occur):
- Founders experiencing burnout or health issues
- Relationship strain due to project pressure
- Complete funding failure across ALL pathways for 12+ months
- No viable land found after extensive search (18+ months)
- Personal finances deteriorating
- Lost enthusiasm or alignment on vision

**If 2+ red flags**: Take 1-3 month break, reassess if project is right fit and timing
