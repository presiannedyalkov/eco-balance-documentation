# Next 90 Days - Bootstrap Launch Actions

**← Back to [[00_Eco_Balance_Hub|Project Hub]]**

---

## 🎯 Bootstrap Mission

The next 90 days are about **getting ready to launch**. Unlike large-scale organization building, we're focusing on **immediate viability**: Finding land, planning the crowdfunding campaign, and preparing to move to the site.

**Timeline:** Months 1-3 (Before land acquisition and site occupation)

**v2.0 Bootstrap Model Focus:**
- ✅ Launch crowdfunding campaign
- ✅ Find and secure 1 hectare site
- ✅ Prepare for immediate site occupation
- ✅ Build community of early supporters
- ❌ NOT building formal organization yet
- ❌ NOT hiring staff
- **Grants:** Apply for 2-3 small grants (€5-15k range)
  - Local environmental grants
  - Small business startup support
  - Regenerative agriculture programs

## Decision Points & Pivots

### Week 2 Check-In:
**Q:** Is land search showing viable options?
- **YES** → Continue as planned
- **NO** → Expand search area, adjust criteria

### Week 6 Check-In:
**Q:** Is crowdfunding campaign gaining traction?
- **YES** → Continue momentum
- **NO** → Adjust messaging, increase outreach, extend campaign

### Week 9 Check-In:
**Q:** Will we hit funding + land goals?
- **YES** → Proceed to equipment orders and closing
- **MAYBE** → Have backup plan ready (scale down, extend timeline)
- **NO** → Reassess approach, consider pause/pivot

### Week 12 Check-In:
**Q:** Are we ready to move to site?
- **YES** → Proceed to Months 4-6 (site setup)
- **NO** → Extend timeline, continue preparation

**Key Principle:** Stay flexible, don't force it. Better to take 120-150 days and do it right than rush and fail.

## After 90 Days: What's Next?

### If Successful (Likely Scenario):

**Months 4-6: Site Setup**
- Move to site (tiny house/caravan installation)
- Solar system installation
- Water system setup
- Basic site prep (access, clearing)
- First plantings!

**See:** [[43_Operations_Action_Plan|Operations Roadmap]]

### If Partially Successful:

**Extended Timeline:**
- Continue fundraising (F&F, small grants)
- Secure land even if equipment delayed
- Phase installation (solar Month 5, housing Month 6)
- Adjust expectations, stay committed

### If Unsuccessful:

**Reassess & Regroup:**
- What went wrong? (Honest analysis)
- Is bootstrap approach still right?
- Do founders still want to do this?
- Pivot to alternative approach or pause

**Don't view "failure" as end - view as learning**

---

## Founder Self-Care Reminders

**This is a marathon, not a sprint:**

✅ Sleep well (7-8 hours)  
✅ Eat well (stress eating is real)  
✅ Exercise (walks in nature = restoration planning!)  
✅ Social time (not just restoration work)  
✅ Creative outlets (music, art, whatever refuels you)

**Signs you need a break:**
- Irritability, short temper
- Decision paralysis
- Loss of enthusiasm
- Physical exhaustion
- Relationship strain

**If you see these signs: TAKE A DAY OFF**

You can't restore nature if you don't restore yourself.

## Inspiration for Hard Days
