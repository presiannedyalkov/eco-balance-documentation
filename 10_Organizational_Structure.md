## 🏛️ Legal Entity

### Structure: gGmbH

**Full Name:** gemeinnützige Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung  
**Translation:** Non-profit limited liability company

**Registration Location:** Bonn, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany

---

## 🏛️ Legal Structure Decision: gGmbH vs e.V.

### Current Plan: gGmbH (gemeinnützige GmbH)
- Nonprofit limited liability company
- €25k share capital requirement
- Tax-exempt status for environmental work
- Professional structure for investors/grants

### Alternative Considered: e.V. (eingetragener Verein)
- Registered association
- Lower entry barrier (€0-€500 setup)
- More suitable for volunteer-driven organizations
- May limit business activities and investment

### Bootstrap Strategy:
- **Year 1:** Operate as informal partnership or UG (haftungsbeschränkt)
- **Year 2:** Establish gGmbH with proven model and capital
- **Reason:** €25k share capital is significant portion of €20-30k bootstrap budget

**Note:** Share capital (€25k) is held as company asset, not spent. However, it ties up funds that could be used for operations. Bootstrap model defers formal gGmbH incorporation until Year 2 when this is feasible.
