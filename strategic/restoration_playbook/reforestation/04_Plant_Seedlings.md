## Purpose

**Proper planting technique** is the most critical moment in the restoration process. Even healthy seedlings from ideal sites will fail if planted incorrectly. This step ensures each tree gets the best possible start.

**This is a template.** Customize planting techniques, timing, and protection methods based on your specific species, site conditions, and climate.

## 🎯 Non-Negotiables (Science Consensus)

These must be followed - they are based on scientific consensus:

1. **Proper Planting Depth:** Seedlings must be planted at correct depth (root collar at soil surface). Planting too deep or too shallow causes mortality.

2. **Root Health:** Roots must be handled carefully and not damaged during planting. Damaged roots lead to poor establishment and mortality.

3. **Timing:** Planting must occur at appropriate time for species and climate. Planting at wrong time causes high mortality.

4. **Initial Watering:** Seedlings must be watered immediately after planting. First watering is critical for establishment.

5. **Protection:** Newly planted seedlings must be protected from herbivores and other threats. Unprotected seedlings have high mortality.

## 🔀 Options & Pathways

### Pathway A: Professional Planting Crew
**When to use:** Larger projects, when quality is critical, have budget, want guaranteed results

**Approach:**
- Professional planting crew
- Trained and experienced
- Proper tools and techniques
- Quality control
- Higher cost but reliable

**Pros:**
- Highest quality
- Professional techniques
- Reliable results
- Efficient

**Cons:**
- Higher cost (€2-5 per seedling)
- Requires professional crew
- May need scheduling

### Pathway B: Trained Volunteer Crew
**When to use:** Community engagement focus, limited budget, want to involve community, educational value

**Approach:**
- Train volunteers in proper techniques
- Supervised planting
- Community work days
- Educational value
- Lower cost

**Pros:**
- Lower cost (€0.50-2 per seedling)
- Community engagement
- Educational value
- Accessible

**Cons:**
- Requires training
- May be slower
- Variable quality
- Needs supervision

### Pathway C: Hybrid Approach
**When to use:** Most projects - balance of professional and volunteer involvement

**Approach:**
- Professional crew for critical areas
- Trained volunteers for other areas
- Professional supervision
- Quality control
- Flexible

**Pros:**
- Good balance
- Cost-effective
- Engages community
- Professional validation

**Cons:**
- Requires coordination
- May need training

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Timing

**Optimal seasons:**
- **Autumn (Oct-Nov):** Best - soil warm, winter rains ahead
- **Early Spring (Feb-Mar):** Good - before summer stress
- **Avoid:** Summer heat and winter freezes

**Time of day:** Early morning or late afternoon (avoid midday heat)

**Weather conditions:**
- Avoid planting during extreme weather
- Don't plant when soil is frozen
- Don't plant when soil is waterlogged
- Wait for favorable conditions

### Step 2: Hole Preparation

**For each tree:**
- Dig hole **2-3x wider** than root ball
- Depth: Same as container/root collar depth (NOT deeper)
- Loosen soil on sides and bottom
- Remove rocks and debris
- Save topsoil separately

### Step 3: Seedling Handling

**Critical care:**
- Keep roots moist until planting (wet burlap covering)
- Never leave roots exposed to sun/wind
- Handle gently - don't drop or damage
- Plant within 30 minutes of removing from container

**Container-grown:**
- Gently remove from pot
- Loosen circling roots
- Prune damaged roots
- Keep root ball intact

**Bare-root:**
- Soak roots 2-4 hours before planting
- Prune broken or damaged roots
- Keep in water bucket until planting
- Never let roots dry out

### Step 4: Placement

**In the hole:**
- Position at correct depth (root collar at soil surface)
- Ensure tree is straight and upright
- Orient best side toward viewing direction
- Root spread naturally (no circling)

### Step 5: Backfilling

**Fill hole carefully:**
- Use native soil mixed with compost (50/50)
- Fill in layers, firming gently
- Eliminate air pockets
- Create slight depression for water retention
- NO soil over root collar

### Step 6: Initial Watering

**First watering is critical:**
- Water deeply immediately after planting
- 10-20 liters per tree (depending on size)
- Let water soak in completely
- Water again if soil sinks
- Creates good soil-root contact

### Step 7: Mulching

**Apply organic mulch:**
- 5-10cm layer around base
- Extend to drip line radius
- Keep mulch away from trunk (5cm gap)
- Suppresses weeds and retains moisture
- Moderates soil temperature

### Step 8: Protection

**Protect young trees:**
- Tree guards against herbivores
- Stakes for support if needed
- Fencing for high-pressure areas
- Mark locations for monitoring
- Document protection measures

### Step 9: Post-Planting Care

**Immediate follow-up:**
- Monitor for first few weeks
- Water as needed (don't overwater)
- Check for problems (pests, disease, damage)
- Replace dead seedlings promptly
- Document survival rates

## 💡 Customization Notes

**When using this template for your project:**

1. **Species-Specific:** Adapt techniques to your specific species (some need different approaches)

2. **Site Conditions:** Adjust methods based on your site (soil, topography, water availability)

3. **Climate:** Adapt timing and care to your specific climate

4. **Budget:** Choose planting pathway based on available resources

5. **Scale:** Adjust methods based on project size

6. **Local Knowledge:** Engage local experts and community members who know the area

**Remember:** This is a template. Your actual project will have specific species, site conditions, and resource constraints that make it unique.
