## Purpose

Community engagement is not a phase that ends—it's an ongoing practice that must be maintained throughout and beyond the restoration project. Sustained, long-term engagement transforms projects into movements and converts temporary improvements into permanent stewardship.

**This is a template.** Customize communication strategies, channels, and frequency based on your specific community, project phase, and resources.

## 🎯 Non-Negotiables (Science Consensus)

These must be followed - they are based on scientific and ethical consensus:

1. **Ongoing Communication Required:** Communication must be ongoing, not one-time. Relationships require continuous communication.

2. **Responsiveness:** Communication must be responsive. Unanswered questions and concerns damage trust.

3. **Transparency:** Communication must be transparent and honest. Misleading or incomplete information destroys trust.

4. **Accessibility:** Communication must be accessible to all stakeholders. Barriers to communication must be addressed.

5. **Documentation:** All communications and community input must be documented. This is essential for accountability and continuity.
