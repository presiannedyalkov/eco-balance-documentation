## Purpose

A comprehensive biodiversity assessment establishes the baseline for conservation efforts. Understanding what species are present, their populations, and their habitats allows you to track progress and make informed management decisions.

**This is a template.** Customize the methods, species lists, and approaches based on your specific site and context.

## 🎯 Non-Negotiables (Science Consensus)

These must be done - they are based on scientific consensus:

1. **Baseline Assessment Required:** Before active restoration, you must establish a baseline of what species exist. You cannot measure progress without knowing the starting point.

2. **Native vs. Non-Native Classification:** All species must be classified as native or non-native. This is essential for restoration planning.

3. **Invasive Species Identification:** If invasive species are present, they must be identified and documented. This is critical for ecosystem health.

4. **Documentation:** All findings must be documented in a format that allows comparison over time. Photos, species lists, and location data are minimum requirements.

5. **Habitat Assessment:** The types and condition of habitats present must be assessed, as this determines what species can survive and thrive.

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Assemble Assessment Team

**Required Expertise (choose based on pathway):**
- Conservation biologist or ecologist (lead) - **Recommended for all pathways**
- Botanist (plant identification) - **Essential**
- Zoologist or wildlife specialist - **Recommended**
- Ornithologist (birds) - **Recommended**
- Entomologist (insects) - Optional but valuable
- Local naturalists (traditional knowledge) - **Highly valuable for all pathways**

### Step 2: Conduct Flora Survey

**Methods (choose based on resources and expertise):**
- Systematic plot surveys (professional approach)
- Transect walks (all approaches)
- Species lists by habitat type (all approaches)
- Herbarium specimens (if needed for identification)

**Document (required for all pathways):**
- All vascular plants (trees, shrubs, herbs)
- Native vs. non-native status - **NON-NEGOTIABLE**
- Abundance (rare, occasional, common, abundant)
- Habitat preferences
- Conservation status (if known)

### Step 3: Conduct Fauna Surveys

**Choose taxa groups based on resources and priorities:**

**Mammals:**
- Camera traps (60-90 day deployment) - Professional/Hybrid
- Track and sign surveys - All pathways
- Hair/scat collection for DNA analysis - Professional
- Night spotlighting - Professional/Hybrid
- Community interviews - All pathways (valuable local knowledge)

**Birds:**
- Point count surveys (dawn chorus) - All pathways
- Breeding bird surveys (spring/summer) - All pathways
- Migration surveys (autumn/spring) - Professional/Hybrid
- Nest searches - All pathways
- Audio recordings - All pathways (citizen science apps)

**Reptiles & Amphibians:**
- Visual encounter surveys - All pathways
- Aquatic surveys (dip netting) - All pathways
- Artificial cover objects - All pathways
- Night surveys with flashlights - All pathways

**Invertebrates:**
- Pitfall traps - Professional/Hybrid
- Sweep netting - All pathways
- Light traps (moths and other insects) - Professional/Hybrid
- Aquatic sampling - Professional/Hybrid
- Focus on indicator groups (butterflies, dragonflies) - All pathways

### Step 4: Habitat Mapping

**Identify and Map (required for all pathways):**
- Woodland areas (canopy cover, species composition)
- Grassland types
- Wetlands and water bodies
- Rock outcrops and cliffs
- Disturbed areas
- Transition zones (ecotones)

**For Each Habitat (required documentation):**
- Extent (area in hectares or approximate)
- Condition (excellent, good, fair, poor)
- Dominant species
- Key wildlife using habitat
- Threats present

### Step 5: Historical Research

**Investigate Past Biodiversity (recommended for all pathways):**
- Historical species records
- Museum specimens
- Scientific publications
- Local knowledge (elders) - **Highly valuable**
- Old photographs or surveys
- Land use history

**Identify Missing Species:**
- Which species have disappeared?
- Why did they disappear?
- Could they return naturally?
- Would reintroduction be appropriate?

### Step 6: Identify Threats

**Document Current Threats (required):**

## 💡 Customization Notes

**When using this template for your project:**

1. **Choose Your Pathway:** Select Professional, Community Science, or Hybrid based on your resources, site size, and goals

2. **Prioritize Taxa:** You may not be able to survey everything. Focus on:
   - Plants (essential - foundation of ecosystem)
   - Birds (highly visible, good indicators)
   - Other taxa based on site characteristics and resources

3. **Local Species Lists:** Replace generic examples with species native to your region

4. **Budget Adaptation:** Adjust methods based on available resources - the system is permissive

5. **Timeline Flexibility:** Adapt timeline based on your project schedule and seasonal constraints

6. **Community Integration:** Even professional assessments benefit from local knowledge - engage community members

**Remember:** This is a template. Your actual project will have specific data, decisions, and circumstances. The non-negotiables must be met, but how you meet them can vary.
