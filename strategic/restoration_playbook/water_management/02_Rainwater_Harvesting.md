## Purpose

Rainwater harvesting is one of the most sustainable and cost-effective water management strategies for restoration sites. By capturing precipitation that would otherwise run off, you can supplement irrigation needs, reduce erosion, recharge groundwater, and build water security.

**This is a template.** Customize harvesting systems, catchment areas, and storage solutions based on your specific climate, site topography, and water needs.

## 🎯 Non-Negotiables (Science Consensus)

These must be followed - they are based on scientific consensus:

1. **Water Quality Matters:** Captured rainwater must be of appropriate quality for intended use. Contaminated water can harm plants, soil, and ecosystem health.

2. **Legal Compliance:** All water capture and storage must comply with local water rights and regulations. This is not optional.

3. **Overflow Management:** All water storage systems must have overflow management. Uncontrolled overflow can cause erosion and flooding.

4. **Maintenance Required:** Water harvesting systems require maintenance to function effectively. Neglected systems fail and waste resources.

5. **Documentation:** All water harvesting systems, capacities, and performance must be documented. This is essential for optimization and adaptive management.

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Understand Rainwater Harvesting Types

**Active harvesting (collection and storage):**
- Roof catchment systems → gutters → storage tanks/cisterns
- Hard surface collection → filters → storage
- Best for: Immediate water needs, irrigation, supplemental supply
- Requires: Infrastructure investment, maintenance
- Yields: High volume from concentrated surfaces

**Passive harvesting (landscape-based infiltration):**
- Swales, berms, and basins that slow and sink water
- Contouring landscape to capture and spread runoff
- Best for: Groundwater recharge, erosion control, long-term soil moisture
- Requires: Earthwork, minimal maintenance
- Yields: Enhanced soil moisture, reduced runoff

**Hybrid approach (recommended):**
- Combine both for maximum benefit
- Active for immediate needs, passive for soil building
- Complimentary strategies that support each other
- Resilience through diversity

### Step 2: Calculate Rainwater Harvesting Potential

**Basic formula:**
**Catchment Area (m²) × Rainfall (mm) × 0.001 = Cubic meters (m³) or 1000 liters captured**

Simplified: **Catchment Area (m²) × Rainfall (mm) = Liters captured**

(Accounting for ~10% loss to evaporation and spillage)

**Example calculations:**

**Roof catchment:**
- Building: 185 m² roof
- Annual rainfall: 762 mm
- Potential: 185 × 762 = 141,000 liters/year (141 m³)

**Hard surface catchment:**
- Parking/driveway: 465 m²
- Annual rainfall: 762 mm
- Potential: 465 × 762 = 354,000 liters/year (354 m³)

**Passive landscape catchment:**
- Swale catchment area: 0.4 hectares (4,047 m²)
- Annual rainfall: 762 mm
- Runoff captured: 4,047 × 762 = 3,084,000 liters/year (3,084 m³)
- (Note: This infiltrates rather than stores for direct use)

**Determine realistic capture percentage:**
- Well-designed system: 75-90% of potential
- Basic system: 50-75% of potential
- Account for overflow, losses, and maintenance downtime

### Step 3: Design Active Roof Catchment System

**Components needed:**

**1. Collection surface (roof):**
- Material considerations: Metal best, asphalt shingles acceptable, avoid treated wood
- Clean surface without debris or contamination
- Sloped for drainage
- Area determines potential volume

**2. Gutters and downspouts:**
- Sized for peak rainfall intensity
- Minimum 13 cm (125-130mm) gutters for most applications
- 75×100 mm downspouts standard
- Secure installation to handle storm flows
- Leaf guards to reduce debris

**3. First-flush diverter:**
- Diverts initial dirty water (bird droppings, dust, debris)
- First 38 liters per 93 m² roof discarded
- Automatic or manual reset
- Critical for water quality

**4. Filtration:**
- Screen filter (200 micron or finer) for debris
- Optional sand or charcoal filters for higher quality
- Inline filters before storage
- Regular cleaning essential

**5. Storage (see [[../../03_Build_Water_Storage_Structures|Build Water Storage Structures]]):**
- Tanks, cisterns, or ponds
- Size based on supply and demand analysis
- Covered to prevent algae, mosquitoes, evaporation
- Overflow system back to landscape

**6. Distribution system:**
- Gravity-fed if possible (elevate tanks)
- Pump if needed for pressure
- Drip irrigation or hose bibs
- Backflow prevention if connecting to any potable system

**Design considerations:**
- Place tanks near collection points (minimize piping)
- Access for maintenance
- Foundation/pad for stability
- Freeze protection in cold climates
- Overflow directed to infiltration areas

### Step 4: Design Passive Landscape Harvesting

**Swales (vegetated infiltration trenches):**
- **Location:** On contour (level along slope)
- **Dimensions:**
  - Width: 0.9-3 meters depending on site
  - Depth: 15-45 cm
  - Length: Along contour
  - Berm on downslope side: 15-30 cm high
- **Spacing:** Every 6-15 meters of vertical elevation
- **Function:** Capture runoff, slow water, allow infiltration
- **Vegetation:** Deep-rooted plants enhance infiltration

**Berms:**
- **Purpose:** Direct water to desired locations
- **Height:** 15-45 cm
- **Width:** 0.6-1.2 meters at base
- **Location:** Along contours, around basins
- **Combination:** Often paired with swales

**Rain gardens/infiltration basins:**
- **Size:** 10-20% of contributing drainage area
- **Depth:** 15-30 cm
- **Location:** Low points that naturally collect water
- **Soil:** Amended for good drainage if needed
- **Plants:** Water-tolerant species that can handle both wet and dry

**Terracing:**
- **Application:** Steep slopes
- **Benefit:** Creates level planting areas, slows runoff
- **Construction:** Cut and fill to create steps
- **Combination:** With berms and swales for maximum effect

**Design process:**
1. Map water flow patterns (observe in rain)
2. Identify high-volume runoff areas
3. Design systems to intercept before leaving site
4. Create overflow paths for extreme events
5. Integrate with planting design

### Step 5: Implement Hard Surface Catchment

**Paved areas (driveways, parking, paths):**
- **Grade toward:** Vegetated areas not storm drains
- **Channel with:** Curbs or berms to infiltration basins
- **Break up large areas:** Create infiltration pockets
- **Permeable paving:** Consider for new construction

**Roof runoff from outbuildings:**
- Don't need full cistern systems for every building
- Direct to rain gardens or swales
- Rain chains as attractive alternatives to downspouts
- Splash blocks to prevent erosion

**Collection at downspouts:**
- Rain barrels (200-400 liters) for small-scale
- Daisy-chain multiple barrels
- Overflow to infiltration areas
- Mosquito screens essential

### Step 6: Install and Test System

**Installation sequence:**

**For active systems:**
1. Install gutters and downspouts (if not present)
2. Install first-flush diverter
3. Install filters
4. Install storage tanks
5. Install distribution system
6. Test all components
7. Monitor first few rain events

**For passive systems:**
1. Mark contours
2. Excavate swales/berms
3. Shape basins
4. Plant vegetation
5. Test during rain
6. Adjust as needed

**Testing:**
- Test during actual rain events
- Check for leaks and overflow
- Verify water quality
- Adjust as needed
- Document performance

### Step 7: Maintain System

**Regular maintenance:**
- Clean gutters and filters regularly
- Inspect tanks and connections
- Check overflow systems
- Maintain vegetation in swales
- Monitor water quality
- Document maintenance activities
