## Purpose

Understanding your site's water needs and availability is the foundation of effective water management. This assessment reveals the gap between natural water supply and plant requirements, identifies opportunities for water harvesting and conservation, and guides decisions about irrigation, storage, and drought preparedness.

**This is a template.** Customize assessment methods, data sources, and calculations based on your specific climate, site conditions, and water availability.

## 🎯 Non-Negotiables (Science Consensus)

These must be followed - they are based on scientific consensus:

1. **Water Assessment Required:** Before designing water systems, you must assess water needs, availability, and patterns. You cannot manage what you don't understand.

2. **Match Plants to Water:** Plant selection must match available water. Planting water-demanding species in arid conditions without adequate water supply will fail.

3. **Water Budget Required:** A water budget (supply vs. demand) must be calculated. This is essential for sustainable water management.

4. **Climate Data:** Historical precipitation and climate data must be used in assessment. Current year data alone is insufficient.

5. **Documentation:** All water assessment data, calculations, and assumptions must be documented. This is essential for adaptive management.

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Research Climate and Precipitation Data

**Gather historical precipitation data:**
- Average annual rainfall for your location
- Monthly distribution of rainfall (seasonal patterns)
- Rainfall variability (drought vs. wet years)
- Snow accumulation if applicable
- Recent trends (last 10-20 years)
- Climate change projections for your region

**Data sources:**
- National weather services
- State climatology offices
- Local weather stations
- Agricultural extension services
- Online climate databases

**Key metrics to collect:**
- Average annual precipitation (inches or mm)
- Wettest and driest months
- Number of rain days per year
- Intensity patterns (gentle rains vs. downpours)
- Frost-free growing season length
- Humidity levels

### Step 2: Calculate Evapotranspiration (ET)

**What is ET:**
- Water lost through plant transpiration + soil evaporation
- Critical for understanding how much water plants actually need
- Varies by temperature, humidity, wind, and plant type

**How to calculate:**
- Use reference ET (ETo) data from weather stations or services
- Multiply ETo by crop coefficient for your vegetation type
- Account for seasonal variation

**Find ETo data:**
- Weather station networks
- Extension service calculators
- Online ET calculators
- Climate databases

**Crop coefficients (Kc):**
- Native grassland: 0.6-0.8
- Forest/woodland: 0.8-1.0
- Agricultural crops: 0.3-1.2 depending on type
- Newly planted areas: 0.5-0.7 during establishment

### Step 3: Assess Soil Water-Holding Capacity

**Why it matters:**
- Soil acts as water storage between rain events
- Different soils hold vastly different amounts
- Determines irrigation frequency and drought vulnerability

**How to assess:**
- Use soil texture to estimate capacity
- Test infiltration rate
- Measure field capacity
- Consider organic matter content (increases capacity)

**Soil water-holding capacity (approximate):**
- Sand: 0.5-1.0 inches per foot
- Loam: 1.5-2.5 inches per foot
- Clay: 2.0-3.0 inches per foot
- Organic matter: Each 1% adds ~0.2 inches per foot

### Step 4: Determine Plant Water Requirements

**Factors affecting requirements:**
- Species type (drought-tolerant vs. water-demanding)
- Plant age (establishment vs. mature)
- Season (growing season vs. dormant)
- Climate (temperature, humidity, wind)

**Calculate for your target vegetation:**
- Research water needs for each species
- Account for establishment period (higher needs)
- Consider seasonal variation
- Plan for mature vs. establishment needs

### Step 5: Create Water Budget

**Water Budget = Supply - Demand**

**Supply (Inputs):**
- Annual precipitation
- Runoff capture potential
- Groundwater (if accessible)
- Surface water (streams, springs)
- Imported water (if available)

**Demand (Outputs):**
- Plant evapotranspiration
- Soil evaporation
- Deep percolation
- Runoff (unavoidable)
- Other uses

**Calculate gap:**
- If Supply > Demand: Water is adequate
- If Supply < Demand: Need to increase supply or reduce demand

**Plan for variability:**
- Drought year scenario
- Wet year scenario
- Seasonal variations

### Step 6: Identify Water Management Needs

**Based on water budget, determine:**
- Do you need irrigation? (If yes, how much?)
- Do you need water storage? (If yes, how much?)
- Do you need water harvesting? (If yes, what type?)
- Can you work within natural water budget? (If yes, select appropriate species)

**Prioritize strategies:**
- Most critical needs first
- Most cost-effective approaches
- Long-term sustainability
- Integration with other restoration activities
