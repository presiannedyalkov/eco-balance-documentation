## Purpose

Monitoring water use is the feedback loop that transforms water management from guesswork into data-driven optimization. Without monitoring, you cannot know if your conservation strategies are working, whether you're over- or under-watering, or how to adjust practices for maximum efficiency.

**This is a template.** Customize monitoring methods, metrics, and frequency based on your specific water systems, needs, and resources.

## 🎯 Non-Negotiables (Science Consensus)

These must be followed - they are based on scientific consensus:

1. **Monitoring Required:** Water use must be monitored. You cannot optimize what you don't measure.

2. **Regular Schedule:** Monitoring must occur on a regular schedule. Irregular monitoring misses patterns and problems.

3. **Documentation:** All water use data must be documented. This is essential for tracking and optimization.

4. **Data Analysis:** Monitoring data must be analyzed. Data without analysis is useless.

5. **Adaptive Management:** Monitoring data must be used to inform management decisions. Monitoring without action is ineffective.

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Establish Baseline Water Use

**Before implementing monitoring system, understand current state:**

**Calculate total annual water use:**
- Irrigation water (from wells, municipal, stored)
- Rainfall capture and use
- Water hauled or delivered
- Any other sources (greywater, recycled, etc.)

**Convert all measurements to consistent units:**
- Gallons, cubic meters, or acre-feet
- Track monthly and annually
- Include seasonal variations

**Document baseline conditions:**
- Total annual volume
- Water sources breakdown (%)
- Peak usage periods
- Cost per unit (if purchasing water)
- Efficiency metrics (gallons per plant, per acre, etc.)

### Step 2: Install Water Meters

**Main supply metering:**

**Municipal water connections:**
- Main meter (utility company provides)
- Sub-meters for different zones if possible
- Location: After pressure regulator, before any splits
- Professional installation recommended
- Record meter number and location

**Well or pump systems:**
- Inline flow meter on pump discharge
- Digital meters provide best data
- Consider meters with data logging
- Installation: Between pump and pressure tank
- May need electrician for powered meters

**Water storage monitoring:**
- Tank level indicators (float switches, ultrasonic sensors)
- Visual gauges or dipsticks for small tanks
- Flow meters on tank outputs
- Recording both inflow and outflow

**Irrigation zone metering:**
- Sub-meters for each major irrigation zone
- Allows comparison of water use by area
- Identifies which zones use most water
- Helps detect zone-specific leaks or inefficiency

**Meter types:**
- **Mechanical:** Reliable, no power needed, less expensive (€50-200)
- **Digital:** More accurate, data logging, expensive (€200-1,000+)
- **Smart meters:** Remote monitoring, real-time data, highest cost (€500-2,000+)

### Step 3: Establish Monitoring Schedule

**Frequency:**
- **Daily:** During active irrigation season
- **Weekly:** During establishment period
- **Monthly:** During maintenance phase
- **Seasonally:** For long-term trends
- **Annually:** Comprehensive review

**What to Monitor:**
- Total water use (all sources)
- Water use by zone/area
- Water storage levels
- Irrigation efficiency
- Plant health indicators
- Weather conditions
- System performance

### Step 4: Record and Document

**Data Collection:**
- Regular meter readings
- Document date, time, and values
- Note conditions (weather, activities)
- Track patterns and trends
- Compare to baseline

**Documentation Methods:**
- Spreadsheet or database
- Field notebooks
- Mobile apps
- Automated data loggers
- Photos and notes

### Step 5: Analyze and Optimize

**Data Analysis:**
- Calculate water use trends
- Identify patterns (seasonal, daily)
- Compare to targets and goals
- Identify inefficiencies
- Calculate efficiency metrics

**Optimization:**
- Adjust irrigation schedules based on data
- Fix leaks and inefficiencies
- Improve system design
- Reduce water use where possible
- Document improvements

### Step 6: Report and Share

**Regular Reporting:**
- Monthly summaries
- Quarterly reviews
- Annual comprehensive reports
- Share with stakeholders
- Document for grants and reporting

**Communication:**
- Share progress with community
- Demonstrate water stewardship
- Educate about water conservation
- Celebrate improvements
