## Purpose

Calculate feasibility, cost, timeline, and success probability for each potential site.

**This is a template.** Customize assessment criteria, cost estimates, and timeline projections based on your specific project goals, resources, and regional context.

## 🎯 Non-Negotiables (Science Consensus)

These must be followed - they are based on scientific consensus:

1. **Comprehensive Assessment Required:** Restoration potential must be assessed using multiple criteria (ecological, financial, social, legal). Single-factor assessments are insufficient.

2. **Realistic Cost Estimates:** Cost estimates must be realistic and include all necessary components. Underestimating costs leads to project failure.

3. **Timeline Considerations:** Restoration timelines must account for ecological processes. Rushing restoration leads to failure.

4. **Success Probability:** Success probability must be assessed honestly. Unrealistic expectations lead to disappointment and failure.

5. **Documentation:** All assessments, estimates, and assumptions must be documented. This is essential for comparison and decision-making.

- Educational value

**Pros:**
- Lowest cost (€100-500)
- Community engagement
- Educational value
- Accessible

**Cons:**
- Less accurate
- May miss issues
- Requires training
- May need validation

### Pathway D: Hybrid Approach
**When to use:** Most projects - balance of professional and community methods

**Approach:**
- Professional assessment for critical aspects
- Community involvement in field work
- Expert consultation as needed
- Mix of professional and field methods

**Pros:**
- Good balance
- Cost-effective

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Restoration Difficulty Rating

**Level 1 - Low Difficulty:**
- Moderate degradation only
- Good soil structure retained
- Native seed sources present
- Natural regeneration possible
- Timeline: 5-10 years
- Cost: Lower end of budget range

**Level 2 - Medium Difficulty:**
- Significant degradation
- Soil needs improvement
- Some invasives present
- Active restoration required
- Timeline: 10-20 years
- Cost: Mid-range of budget

**Level 3 - High Difficulty:**
- Severe degradation
- Soil heavily compacted or eroded
- Extensive invasives
- Major interventions needed
- Timeline: 20-30+ years
- Cost: Higher end of budget range

### Step 2: Success Probability Factors

**High Probability (>80%):**
- Suitable climate for target ecosystem
- Reversible degradation
- Local community support
- Water available
- No major contamination

**Medium Probability (50-80%):**
- Climate marginally suitable
- Challenging but manageable degradation
- Neutral community stance
- Water management needed
- Minor remediation required

**Low Probability (<50%):**
- Climate incompatible
- Irreversible damage
- Community opposition
- Severe water scarcity
- Serious contamination

### Step 3: Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Benefits (quantify where possible):**
- Carbon sequestration (tons CO2)
- Biodiversity increase (species)
- Soil improvement (hectares)
- Water retention (liters)
- Community employment (jobs)
- Education value (visitors)

**Costs:**
- Land acquisition
- Site preparation
- Planting materials
- Infrastructure
- Labor (Years 1-5)
- Long-term management
- Monitoring

**Calculate:**
- Cost per unit benefit (€/ton CO2, €/species)
- Break-even timeline
- Return on investment metrics

### Step 4: Timeline Estimation

**Factors affecting timeline:**
- Degradation level
- Restoration approach
- Climate and growing conditions
- Available resources
- Community support
- Legal/regulatory requirements

**Typical timelines:**
- Low difficulty: 5-10 years
- Medium difficulty: 10-20 years
- High difficulty: 20-30+ years

**Phases:**
- Year 1-3: Initial establishment
- Year 3-10: Active management
- Year 10+: Reduced management, monitoring

### Step 5: Risk Assessment

**Identify risks:**
- Climate change impacts
- Extreme weather events
- Pest and disease outbreaks
- Community opposition
- Funding shortfalls
- Legal/regulatory changes

**Assess probability and impact:**
- High probability, high impact: Major concern
- High probability, low impact: Manageable
- Low probability, high impact: Plan for
- Low probability, low impact: Monitor

**Mitigation strategies:**
- Diversify approaches
- Build resilience
- Maintain flexibility
- Plan for contingencies

### Step 6: Compare Sites

**Create comparison matrix:**
- Restoration difficulty
- Success probability
- Cost estimates
- Timeline projections
- Risk assessment
- Community support
- Legal feasibility

**Rank sites:**
- Best overall match
- Best value
- Lowest risk
- Fastest results
- Highest impact
