## Purpose

There is no substitute for physically visiting potential sites. Remote research and data provide important information, but only an in-person visit reveals the true character, opportunities, and challenges of a location.

**This is a template.** Customize visit planning, assessment methods, and documentation approaches based on your specific project needs and site characteristics.

## 🎯 Non-Negotiables (Science Consensus)

These must be followed - they are based on practical and scientific consensus:

1. **On-Site Visit Required:** Sites must be visited in person before selection. Remote assessment alone is insufficient.

2. **Permission Required:** All site visits must have landowner permission. Trespassing is illegal and damages relationships.

3. **Documentation Required:** All site visits must be documented. This is essential for comparison and decision-making.

4. **Expert Input:** Site visits should include relevant experts when possible. Expert input improves assessment quality.

5. **Multiple Visits:** Multiple visits (different seasons/times) provide better information than single visits.

**Cons:**
- Higher cost (€1,000-5,000+)
- Requires professional expertise
- May take longer

### Pathway B: Expert-Guided Team Visit
**When to use:** Standard projects, moderate budget, want expert input at lower cost

**Approach:**
- Expert consultation on methodology
- Team conducts visit with expert guidance
- Expert review of findings
- Mix of professional and field methods

**Pros:**
- Lower cost (€300-1,500)
- Professional guidance

- Good balance

**Cons:**
- Less comprehensive
- Requires coordination
- May need expert review

### Pathway C: Community-Led Visit
**When to use:** Limited budget, strong community interest, local knowledge important, educational focus

**Approach:**
- Community members conduct visit
- Local knowledge integration
- Expert review of results
- Educational value

**Pros:**
- Lowest cost (€100-500)
- Community engagement
- Integrates local knowledge
- Accessible

**Cons:**
- May be less comprehensive
- Requires training
- May need validation

### Pathway D: Hybrid Approach
**When to use:** Most projects - balance of professional and community involvement

**Approach:**
- Professional guidance on priorities
- Community involvement in field work
- Expert consultation as needed
- Mix of professional and field methods

**Pros:**
- Good balance
- Cost-effective
- Flexible
- Engages community

**Cons:**
- Requires coordination
- May need ongoing consultation

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Plan the Visit

**Logistics:**
- Schedule visits for appropriate season (avoid extreme weather)
- Allocate sufficient time (full day minimum per site)
- Plan for multiple visits if possible (different seasons/times)
- Arrange transportation and accommodation
- Prepare equipment and materials

**Permissions:**
- Confirm access permission from landowner → [[../../06_Contact_Landowners|Contact Landowners]]
- Understand any restrictions or sensitive areas
- Inform local authorities if required
- Bring written permission if needed

**Team Composition:**
- Include ecological restoration expert
- Include project manager/decision-maker
- Include community liaison (if available)
- Local guide who knows the area
- Translator if language barrier exists

**Weather Considerations:**
- Check forecast
- Plan for rain/sun protection
- Consider how weather affects site assessment
- Visit during wet season if possible (shows water patterns)

### Step 2: Prepare Equipment and Materials

**Documentation Tools:**
- Camera (good quality, extra batteries/memory cards)
- Video camera or phone for video documentation
- Notepad and pens (waterproof if possible)
- Tablet for digital note-taking
- GPS device or GPS-enabled phone
- Compass
- Voice recorder for detailed observations
- Drone (if permitted and you have piloting skills)

**Assessment Tools:**
- Soil testing kit (pH, NPK, moisture)
- Measuring tape (long, 30-50m)
- Binoculars for wildlife observation
- Plant/tree identification guides
- Magnifying glass
- Small sampling containers (soil, water)
- Flagging tape to mark areas of interest
- Clinometer (for slope measurements)

**Safety Equipment:**
- First aid kit
- Water and snacks
- Appropriate footwear (hiking boots)
- Weather-appropriate clothing
- Sun protection (hat, sunscreen)
- Insect repellent
- Mobile phone with emergency numbers
- Whistle
- Map and compass (backup to GPS)

**Reference Materials:**
- Property maps and boundaries
- Satellite imagery printouts
- Previous assessment reports
- Species checklists for the region
- Assessment forms and checklists

### Step 3: Conduct Site Assessment

**Physical Assessment:**
- Walk entire site systematically
- Note topography and slopes
- Assess soil conditions
- Identify water features
- Document vegetation
- Note wildlife signs
- Assess accessibility

**Ecological Assessment:**
- Identify existing species (native vs. invasive)
- Assess habitat quality
- Note biodiversity indicators
- Identify restoration opportunities
- Document constraints

**Infrastructure Assessment:**
- Road and access conditions
- Existing structures
- Utilities availability
- Water sources
- Communication access

**Community Assessment:**
- Meet neighbors if possible
- Assess community context
- Note local land uses
- Understand local dynamics

### Step 4: Document Findings

**Photography:**
- Take comprehensive photos
- Document key features
- Create photo points for repeat visits
- Before/after potential
- Video documentation

**Notes:**
- Detailed written observations
- GPS coordinates for key locations
- Species lists
- Condition assessments
- Opportunities and constraints

**Maps:**
- Sketch site layout
- Mark key features
- Note boundaries
- Document access routes

**Data Collection:**
- Soil samples for testing
- Water samples if applicable
- Species identification
- Measurements and dimensions

### Step 5: Compare Sites

**Create Comparison Matrix:**
- Ecological potential
- Restoration difficulty
- Cost estimates
- Accessibility
- Community context
- Legal feasibility
- Timeline projections

**Rank Sites:**
- Best overall match
- Best value
- Lowest risk
- Fastest results
- Highest impact
