## Purpose

Conduct desktop research to identify promising regions and sites that match restoration goals and project requirements.

**This is a template.** Customize search criteria, geographic focus, and evaluation factors based on your specific project goals, location, and constraints.

## 🎯 Non-Negotiables (Science Consensus)

These must be followed - they are based on scientific consensus:

1. **Site Assessment Required:** Before selecting a site, a comprehensive assessment must be conducted. You cannot determine site suitability without proper evaluation.

2. **Legal Compliance:** All sites must comply with local, regional, and national land use regulations. Sites that cannot be legally used for restoration must be excluded.

3. **Contamination Assessment:** Sites with contamination that cannot be safely managed must be avoided or contamination must be addressed before restoration begins.

4. **Water Availability:** Adequate water (rainfall, groundwater, or managed systems) must be available or feasible to provide for restoration success.

5. **Native Ecosystem Potential:** Sites must have potential to support native ecosystems. Sites where native restoration is ecologically impossible should be excluded.

## 🔀 Options & Pathways

### Pathway A: Broad Geographic Search
**When to use:** Flexible on location, want to find best site regardless of geography, exploring multiple regions

**Approach:**
- Search across multiple regions or countries
- Compare different geographic options
- Evaluate based on restoration potential
- Consider relocation if needed

**Pros:**
- Find best restoration opportunities
- Compare different contexts
- May find better deals
- More options

**Cons:**
- More research required
- May be far from team base
- Less local knowledge
- More complex logistics

### Pathway B: Local/Regional Focus
**When to use:** Want to stay local, have local connections, want to work in familiar area, limited travel ability

**Approach:**
- Focus search on specific region
- Use local knowledge and connections
- Prioritize accessibility
- Build on existing relationships

**Pros:**
- Leverage local knowledge
- Easier logistics
- Existing relationships
- Lower travel costs

**Cons:**
- Fewer options
- May miss better opportunities
- Limited by local constraints
- May have higher land costs locally

### Pathway C: Opportunity-Based Search
**When to use:** Open to opportunities, flexible on criteria, want to act on good opportunities quickly

**Approach:**
- Monitor for opportunities (land sales, donations, partnerships)
- Evaluate opportunities as they arise
- Flexible criteria
- Quick decision-making

**Pros:**
- Can act on good opportunities
- May find unexpected deals
- Flexible approach
- Can move quickly

**Cons:**
- Less systematic
- May miss better options
- Reactive rather than proactive
- May need to evaluate quickly

### Pathway D: Targeted Search
**When to use:** Have specific criteria, know what you want, have clear priorities

**Approach:**
- Define specific search criteria
- Systematic search using criteria
- Evaluate all options against criteria
- Select best match

**Pros:**
- Most systematic
- Clear decision-making
- Focused search
- Efficient process

**Cons:**
- May miss good opportunities
- Rigid criteria
- May take longer
- Less flexible

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Define Search Criteria

**Climate:**
- Temperature ranges and extremes
- Annual rainfall and seasonal patterns
- Growing season length
- Climate change projections
- Drought and extreme weather patterns

**Geography:**
- Target regions or countries
- Proximity to team base (if relevant)
- Accessibility requirements
- Proximity to existing natural areas
- Watershed or landscape context

**Degradation Type:**
- Former agricultural land
- Depleted forest areas
- Post-industrial sites
- Eroded or compacted soil
- Areas with reduced biodiversity

**Size:**
- Minimum and maximum area
- Scalability potential
- Manageability with available resources

**Other Factors:**
- Legal/regulatory context
- Community context
- Cost constraints
- Timeline requirements

### Step 2: Use Mapping Tools

**Resources:**
- Google Earth / satellite imagery
- Climate atlases and projections
- Topographic and land use data
- Protected area databases
- Forestry agency maps
- Agricultural land registries
- Real estate listings

### Step 3: Identify Candidate Regions

Create list of potential regions based on:
- Environmental match to criteria
- Geographic distribution
- Known land degradation issues
- Existing conservation interest
- Land availability and affordability
- Accessibility

### Step 4: Research Each Region

**Environmental:**
- Native ecosystems
- Historical ecology
- Current state of degradation
- Existing protected areas nearby
- Water bodies and watershed health
- Climate and weather patterns

**Social:**
- Community context
- Local support for restoration
- Potential partnerships
- Cultural considerations

**Economic:**
- Land prices
- Restoration costs
- Funding opportunities
- Economic context

**Legal:**
- Land use regulations
- Environmental permits required
- Protected area designations
- Water rights

### Step 5: Create Initial Shortlist

**Document for Each Candidate:**
- Location and coordinates
- Size and characteristics
- Key advantages
- Key challenges
- Initial suitability rating
- Next steps needed
