# Step 8: Make Shortlist - Project Template

**Type:** Template/Playbook for Small Plot Restoration  
**Status:** Template - Customize for Your Project

## Purpose

After conducting thorough research, assessments, and site visits, it's time to synthesize all information and create a shortlist of the most suitable locations for your restoration project. This critical step requires balancing multiple factors - ecological potential, practical considerations, financial constraints, and strategic alignment with your mission.

**This is a template.** Customize evaluation criteria, scoring systems, and decision-making processes based on your specific project goals, priorities, and constraints.

## 🎯 Non-Negotiables (Science Consensus)

These must be followed - they are based on practical and strategic consensus:

1. **Comprehensive Evaluation Required:** Site selection must be based on comprehensive evaluation of all factors. Single-factor decisions are insufficient.

2. **Documentation Required:** All evaluation criteria, scores, and decisions must be documented. This is essential for transparency and future reference.

3. **Objective Comparison:** Sites must be compared objectively using consistent criteria. Subjective decisions without documentation are problematic.

4. **Multiple Options:** Shortlist should include multiple options when possible. Single-option decisions lack flexibility.

5. **Stakeholder Input:** Stakeholder input should be considered in site selection. Community support is essential for success.

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Compile All Site Data

**Gather Information:**
- Desk research findings → [[../../01_Identify_Potential_Locations|Initial Research]]
- Land condition assessments → [[../../02_Evaluate_Land_Condition|Land Evaluation]]
- Restoration potential estimates → [[../../03_Estimate_Restoration_Potential|Restoration Potential]]
- Accessibility evaluations → [[../../04_Consider_Accessibility|Accessibility]]
- Regulatory research → [[../../05_Research_Local_Regulations|Regulations]]
- Landowner communication notes → [[../../06_Contact_Landowners|Landowner Contact]]
- Site visit reports → [[../../07_Visit_Sites|Site Visits]]

**Create Master Spreadsheet:**
- List all candidate sites
- Compile key data points for each
- Include costs and timelines
- Note opportunities and challenges
- Record stakeholder input
- Document regulatory status

### Step 2: Define Decision Criteria

**Essential Criteria (Must-Haves):**
These are non-negotiable - sites failing any of these are eliminated:

- [ ] **Legal Access:** Can legally acquire or lease the land
- [ ] **Budget Fit:** Acquisition costs within available budget
- [ ] **Size Appropriate:** Appropriate size for project
- [ ] **Restoration Viable:** Degradation severe enough to justify intervention, but not impossible
- [ ] **Regulatory Feasible:** Can obtain necessary permits within reasonable timeline
- [ ] **Safety:** Safe for staff and visitors to access and work
- [ ] **Geographic:** Located in target region

**Sites failing essential criteria are eliminated immediately.**

### Step 3: Develop Scoring Matrix

**Weighted Scoring System:**

Create a systematic way to compare sites objectively:

#### A. Ecological Factors (35% weight)

| Criterion | Weight | Description | Score 1-5 |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Degradation Level | 8% | Severe enough to justify, possible to restore | ___ |
| Biodiversity Potential | 7% | Remnant species, habitat diversity potential | ___ |
| Soil Quality/Potential | 7% | Current condition, restoration feasibility | ___ |
| Water Availability | 7% | Natural sources, rainfall, harvesting potential | ___ |
| Climate Resilience | 6% | Ability to withstand climate stresses | ___ |

**Ecological Subtotal:** ___/25 × 35% = ___/35

#### B. Practical Factors (30% weight)

| Criterion | Weight | Description | Score 1-5 |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Accessibility | 10% | Road access, logistics, year-round viability | ___ |
| Infrastructure | 7% | Utilities, accommodation, existing structures | ___ |
| Size & Configuration | 7% | Appropriate size, good shape, usable area | ___ |
| Neighborhood Context | 6% | Compatible land uses, minimal conflicts | ___ |

**Practical Subtotal:** ___/25 × 30% = ___/30

#### C. Financial Factors (20% weight)

| Criterion | Weight | Description | Score 1-5 |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Acquisition Cost | 8% | Purchase price or lease cost | ___ |
| Restoration Cost | 7% | Estimated restoration investment needed | ___ |
| Ongoing Costs | 5% | Maintenance, management, utilities | ___ |

**Financial Subtotal:** ___/25 × 20% = ___/20

#### D. Strategic Factors (15% weight)

| Criterion | Weight | Description | Score 1-5 |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Mission Alignment | 6% | Fits project goals and values | ___ |
| Community Support | 5% | Local support and engagement potential | ___ |
| Demonstration Value | 4% | Educational, visibility, replication potential | ___ |

**Strategic Subtotal:** ___/25 × 15% = ___/15

**Total Score:** ___/100

### Step 4: Score Each Site

**For each candidate site:**
- Score each criterion (1-5 scale)
- Calculate weighted subtotals
- Calculate total score
- Document rationale for scores
- Note any exceptional factors

**Scoring Guidelines:**
- 5 = Excellent (best possible)
- 4 = Good (strong positive)
- 3 = Average (acceptable)
- 2 = Below average (concerning)
- 1 = Poor (major problem)

### Step 5: Create Shortlist

**Rank Sites:**
- Sort by total score
- Identify top 2-3 sites
- Consider exceptional factors
- Balance scores with practical considerations

**Shortlist Criteria:**
- Top scoring sites
- Diverse options (if possible)
- Different strengths/weaknesses
- Manageable number (2-3 typically)

### Step 6: Document and Present

**Create Shortlist Report:**
- Summary of evaluation process
- Site profiles for shortlisted sites
- Comparison matrix
- Recommendations
- Next steps

**Present to Decision-Makers:**
- Clear presentation of findings
- Visual comparisons
- Recommendations with rationale
- Discussion and decision
