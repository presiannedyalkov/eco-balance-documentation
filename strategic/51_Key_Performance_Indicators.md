## 🎯 Adaptation Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Measure what matters at the level you can afford and sustain.

**Tier 1 is ALWAYS good enough** to prove basic impact:
- "We planted 2,000 trees, 80% survived, here are monthly photos showing forest growing, we spent €25k and have €5k left, 150 volunteers contributed 400 hours."
- → This is credible, transparent, sufficient for small-medium funders and community trust.

**Tier 2 adds credibility** for larger funders:
- "Soil organic carbon increased 15%, water quality tested good, community survey 8/10 satisfaction."
- → This is professional, verified by labs, suitable for larger grants and partnerships.

**Tier 3 proves scientific rigor** for research and major programs:
- "Microbial biomass increased 60% (verified), 45 tons CO₂ sequestered (third-party verified), economic impact study shows €250k local economic activity, peer-reviewed publication accepted."
- → This is research-grade, suitable for carbon credits, major foundations, academic credibility.

**But**: Don't skip Tier 1 trying to jump to Tier 3. Don't spend Tier 3 money when you have Tier 1 budget.

**Adapt monitoring to match your reality** - budget, capacity, partnerships, funder requirements. Start simple, add complexity as resources allow.
