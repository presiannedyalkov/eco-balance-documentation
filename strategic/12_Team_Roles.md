## 🎯 Team Framework: Vision + Adaptive Reality

### Vision
**What We Want to Achieve**:
- Sustainable team capacity that matches project scale and revenue
- Essential skills covered across all critical functions
- Healthy work-life balance (avoid burnout)
- Team grows organically as project succeeds

### Core Requirements (Non-Negotiable)
- **Founder financial security**: Maintain jobs Years 1-2 to cover living expenses (€15-30k/year per person)
- **Sustainable workload**: Part-time commitment that doesn't cause burnout
- **Essential skills coverage**: Restoration ecology, project management, fundraising, communications (by founders or advisors)
- **Legal requirements met**: Minimum members if legal structure requires (e.g., e.V. needs 7 members)

### How We'll Build the Team (Flexible, Adaptive)
- **Year 1-2 work model**: Part-time (15-25 hr/week), founders keep jobs for income
- **Year 2-4 transition**: Part-time to full-time based on project revenue
- **Year 4+ potential**: Full-time if revenue supports it (€30-50k/year stable)
- **Team scaling**: Based on actual growth, not assumptions

### Current Status
- **Decided**: 1-2 core founders, part-time Year 1-2, keep jobs for security
- **TBD**: When to transition to full-time (depends on revenue), when/if to hire (depends on growth)
- **Decision Criteria**: Revenue stability, workload sustainability, impact potential

## Adaptation Note

**This document describes possible team structures and scaling pathways.** The actual team composition, timeline, and growth will adapt based on:
- Project success and impact achieved
- Revenue stability and growth
- Founder capacity and preferences
- Partnership opportunities that emerge
- Workload requirements as site scales

**Current baseline**: 1-2 founders, part-time Year 1-2 (15-25 hr/week, keep jobs), evaluate transition Year 3+ based on results.

**Key Philosophy**: Team growth follows success, not assumptions. We stay lean until revenue and impact justify expansion. Founder security and sustainability are non-negotiable constraints.
