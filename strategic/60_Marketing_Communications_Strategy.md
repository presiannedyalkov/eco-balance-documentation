## ✅ Decision Framework Summary

### Month 1-2 Decisions:
- [ ] Choose primary communication platform (Instagram OR LinkedIn OR both)
- [ ] Decide crowdfunding timeline (Option A: 3-month, B: 5-month, C: 9-month, or D: Skip)
- [ ] Set up foundation (website, email, social, brand)

### Month 2-3 Decisions:
- [ ] Evaluate crowdfunding readiness (email list growing? engagement good? time available?)
- [ ] If not ready: Delay campaign OR pivot to grants/bootstrap
- [ ] Choose crowdfunding platform (Kickstarter, Indiegogo, Betterplace, other)

### Month 4-6 Decisions (if Option B timeline):
- [ ] Go/No-Go on crowdfunding campaign (based on email list size, soft commitments, readiness)
- [ ] If Go: Launch campaign
- [ ] If No-Go: Pivot to alternative funding pathway, continue audience building

### Post-Campaign:
- [ ] Evaluate campaign results and lessons learned
- [ ] Adapt communication strategy based on what worked/didn't work
- [ ] Convert backers to ongoing supporters

## 🎯 Current Status & Next Steps

**Current Status** (Month 0):
- **Decided**: Need communication strategy to support potential crowdfunding or other awareness goals
- **Exploring**: Platform options, timeline options, content strategies
- **TBD**: Final crowdfunding decision (go/no-go), primary platform choice, exact timeline

**Decision Timeline**:
- **Month 1-2**: Choose platforms and begin foundation setup
- **Month 2-3**: Assess crowdfunding viability and set timeline
- **Month 4-6**: Launch campaign (if pursuing) OR continue building for later campaign
- **Ongoing**: Adapt based on results, opportunities, and constraints as they emerge

**Triggers to Accelerate**:
- Strong existing network (500+ engaged contacts) → Fast track crowdfunding (Option A)
- Major grant requires matching funds → Accelerate campaign for match
- Perfect land opportunity with tight timeline → Urgent fundraising needed

**Triggers to Decelerate or Pivot**:
- Email list growing too slowly (&lt;100 after 2 months) → Delay campaign or pivot to grants
- Founder time more constrained than expected → Slow build (Option C) or skip crowdfunding (Option D)
- Better funding opportunity emerges (grant, patron, partnership) → Pivot away from crowdfunding

**Adaptation Note**: This marketing and communications strategy describes possible approaches. Actual strategy will adapt based on founder time availability, target audience response, platform performance, and funding pathway chosen (crowdfunding vs grants vs other). All timelines, platforms, and tactics are flexible and will be finalized based on Month 1-3 exploration results and ongoing performance data.
