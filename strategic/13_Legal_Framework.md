## Key Takeaways

✅ **Multiple viable pathways** - e.V. (Germany), Associação (Portugal), or equivalents in Spain/France/Italy

✅ **Decision driven by location** - Where you operate determines structure to choose

✅ **Cost range: €500-35k** - Low-cost options (€500-2k) available, expensive gGmbH deferred unless budget justifies

✅ **Timeline: 4-8 weeks** - Once location decided, registration takes 4-8 weeks for most options

✅ **Professional help essential** - Budget €500-2,000 for lawyer/tax advisor in chosen country

✅ **Compliance is critical** - Nonprofit status requires ongoing annual maintenance

✅ **Flexibility maintained** - Final decision deferred until Month 5-6 when location and funding clarify

## Adaptation Note

This framework presents viable legal pathways across Europe. The actual structure chosen will depend on:
1. **Which country offers best opportunity** (grants, land, partnerships)
2. **Budget available** (€500-2k association vs €30k+ gGmbH)
3. **Timeline urgency** (fast e.V./Loi 1901 vs slower gGmbH)
4. **Revenue model** (grant-focused = association, commercial = gGmbH)

**Current approach**: Explore all pathways in parallel (Month 1-6), commit to final structure once location decided, register within 4-8 weeks of decision.

**Default if no opportunity by Month 6**: Germany (e.V. if budget &lt;€30k, consider gGmbH if budget >€30k and commercial revenue planned)
