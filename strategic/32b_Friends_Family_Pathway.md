### Conversation Framework

**DON'T:**

2. **Explain the Ask** (1 minute)
   - "We're raising €25,000 to get started"
   - Breakdown: housing, solar, initial plantings

   - **Option B:** Interest-free loan (repay Year 3-5)
   - **Option C:** Combination (€500 gift + €500 loan)

4. **Answer Questions** (5-10 minutes)
   - Be honest about risks and challenges
   - Share your plan and backup plans
   - Explain how you'll stay accountable

5. **Give Time** (leave open)
