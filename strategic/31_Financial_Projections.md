## Adaptation Notes

**This financial projection document is adaptive**:
- Projections will update based on actual results (quarterly review)
- Scenario choice made Month 4-6 based on funding reality
- Revenue projections adjusted based on Year 1-2 actual performance
- Operating costs updated based on site selection and actual expenses
- Willing to shift scenarios if major opportunities or constraints emerge

**Honest uncertainty**:
- We cannot predict exact revenue in Year 5 (range: €20-70k)
- We don't know which funding pathway will work best (exploring all)
- We don't know final location (affects costs significantly)
- We don't know founder time availability in Year 3+ (life circumstances)

**What we DO know**:
- Minimum viable investment: €8,000 (can start with this)
- Maximum realistic need: €75-85k over 5-7 years (cumulative)
- Sustainability achievable: Year 5-7 with revenue €20-45k/year
- Multiple pathways exist: Not dependent on single scenario working

**Current status**: Month 0 - Exploring all scenarios, will commit to pathway Month 4-6 based on what emerges.

**Status:** Active
