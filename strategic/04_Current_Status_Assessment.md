## 🎯 Current Phase: Exploration & Opportunity Discovery

**Phase:** Month 0 - Planning and Opportunity Exploration
**Date:** November 2025
**Philosophy:** Adaptive, opportunistic, flexible pathways to execution

---

## 🎬 What Happens Next

### Month 1-3: Active Exploration

**Your focus:**
1. **Research grants** in Germany, Portugal, other EU
2. **Network actively** - reach out to NGOs, universities, potential mentors
3. **Monitor land opportunities** - set up alerts, browse listings
4. **Explore partnerships** - where can we find support?
5. **(If crowdfunding route)** Start building audience - social media, content, email list
6. **Stay flexible** - don't commit to anything yet

**What NOT to do:**
- ❌ Don't register legal entity yet (wait for location)
- ❌ Don't commit to crowdfunding campaign yet (wait to see if audience grows)
- ❌ Don't sign up for land yet (wait for location + funding)
- ❌ Don't quit your job yet (keep security)

### Month 3-4: Evaluation & Decision Prep

**Your focus:**
1. **Assess progress:**
   - Which funding pathways showing promise?
   - Any strong grant opportunities identified?
   - Is crowdfunding audience growing? (target: 50+ soft commitments)
   - Any partnership opportunities emerging?
   - Any exceptional land offers?

2. **Prepare to commit:**
   - If crowdfunding looking good → Prep for Month 5-6 launch
   - If grants looking good → Finalize applications
   - If bootstrap only → Plan Year 1 ultra-lean approach
   - If partnership emerging → Negotiate terms

**Decision:** Commit to 1-2 primary pathways by end of Month 4

---

### Month 4-6: Commitment & Execution

**Your focus:**
1. **Execute chosen pathway(s):**
   - If crowdfunding → Launch campaign Month 5-6
   - If grants → Submit 5-10 applications
   - If partnership → Formalize agreement
   - If bootstrap → Confirm founder contributions, plan Year 1

2. **Finalize location:**
   - Where did opportunities emerge? → Go there
   - No clear opportunity? → Default to Germany
   - Decide by Month 6

3. **Choose legal structure:**
   - Based on location chosen
   - Engage lawyer if needed

**Output:** By Month 6, you have clarity on funding, location, legal structure

---

### Month 6-12: Execution

**Your focus:**
1. **Secure funding** (execute on chosen pathway)
2. **Register legal entity** (4-8 weeks)
3. **Search for land** (10-15 sites → 5 visits → 1 chosen)
4. **Build partnerships** (1-2 MOUs)
5. **Public presence** (if needed for funding)

**Output:** By Month 12, funding secured, entity registered, land acquired

---

### Month 12-18: Operations

**Your focus:**
1. **Site setup** (infrastructure, tools, water, shelter)
2. **Initial plantings** (200-500 trees)
3. **Baseline measurements**
4. **Community relationships**
5. **Documentation** (proof of concept)

**Output:** Operational restoration site, proof of concept demonstrated
