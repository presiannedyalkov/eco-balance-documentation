## 💧 Water Systems - Location-Adaptive Strategies

### Vision: Reliable Water Supply for Living and Restoration

**Core Requirements**:
- Potable water for drinking and cooking (safe filtration)
- Sufficient water for basic hygiene and sanitation
- Irrigation water for plant establishment (Year 1-2, then minimal)
- Legal compliance (water rights, quality standards)
- Affordable ongoing costs

---

### Climate-Adaptive Water Strategies

Water systems must adapt to location rainfall patterns:

#### **TEMPERATE CLIMATE** (Germany, Northern France, etc.)

**Climate Data**:
- Rainfall: 700-800 mm/year
- Distribution: Year-round, slight summer low
- Challenges: Winter freeze (storage protection needed)

**Rainwater Potential** (20 m² roof catchment):
- 20 m² × 700 mm = 14,000 L/year theoretical
- Actual collection: 10,000-12,000 L/year (accounting for losses)

#### **MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE** (Portugal, Spain, Southern France, Italy)

**Climate Data**:
- Rainfall: 400-600 mm/year
- Distribution: Winter-focused (Oct-Mar), summer drought
- Challenges: Summer deficit, intense storms, high evaporation

**Rainwater Potential** (20 m² roof catchment):
- 20 m² × 500 mm = 10,000 L/year theoretical
- Actual collection: 7,000-9,000 L/year (accounting for losses)

---

### Water Usage Budget (Location-Independent)

**Daily Consumption (2 people)**:
- Drinking & cooking: 10-15 L/day
- Washing & cleaning: 30-50 L/day
- Toilet (composting reduces to ~5 L/day): 5-10 L/day
- **Total indoor: 45-75 L/day = 16,000-27,000 L/year**

**Irrigation (Growing Season)**:
- Nursery/seedlings: 20-50 L/day (3-4 months)
- Establishment watering: 50-100 L/day (peak summer, 2-3 months)
- Mature plants: Minimal (rain-dependent)
- **Annual irrigation: 5,000-15,000 L/year**

**Total Annual Need: 21,000-42,000 L/year**

### Water Decision Criteria

**Choose between options based on**:

1. **Location climate?**
   - Temperate (700mm+) → Option A, C, D, or E
   - Mediterranean (400-600mm) → Option B, C, or D (rainwater alone insufficient)

2. **Is municipal water or well possible at site?**
   - Municipal accessible + connection < €2k → Option D strong candidate
   - Aquifer confirmed + budget €5-10k → Option C eliminates delivery costs
   - Neither → Must use rainwater + delivery (A, B, or E)

3. **What's water setup budget?**
   - < €2k → Option A or B (basic rainwater + delivery)
   - €2-5k → Option C (well) or E (expanded rainwater)
   - < €1k → May need delivery-only Year 1, add rainwater Year 2

4. **Can tolerate ongoing delivery costs?**
   - Yes (€1-3k/year acceptable) → Options A or B simple and low upfront
   - No (prefer higher upfront, low ongoing) → Option C (well) if possible

5. **Long-term plan (5+ years)?**
   - Yes → Option C (well) worth investment
   - No (testing 1-2 years) → Options A/B (low commitment)

**Current Status**:
- **Decided**: Need water system capable of 20-40k L/year for 2 people + restoration
- **TBD**: Exact option (A/B/C/D/E) pending site selection and climate
- **Most Likely**: Option A (temperate) or B (Mediterranean) with rainwater + delivery
- **Decision timing**: Finalize within 2 weeks of site selection (geological survey for well, municipal access check)

### What We're NOT Doing in Bootstrap Phase (And Why)

**❌ Atmospheric Water Generator (AWG) - Not in Bootstrap Plan**:
- Cost: €15,000-30,000 (10-20× rainwater cost)
- Energy: 5-10 kW solar required (doubles solar budget)
- Output: 100-500 L/day (still insufficient for all needs)
- Complexity: High maintenance, technical expertise
- **Bootstrap Verdict**: Not viable at bootstrap scale (€20-30k total budget)
- **Future Vision**: Creating water from air using solar energy remains a long-term aspiration - a sustainable water source that doesn't depend on rainfall or wells. This is part of the vision layer, not the bootstrap execution plan.

**❌ Desalination**:
- Only relevant for coastal brackish/saltwater (site-dependent)
- Cost: €5,000-15,000 for small system
- Energy-intensive (high solar requirement)
- **Verdict**: Not applicable unless coastal site with no other water source

**Why Rainwater + Delivery (or Well) Makes Sense for Bootstrap**:
- Total cost: €1,000-5,000 setup vs €15k+ for AWG
- Simple, proven, maintainable
- Expandable as budget allows (add tanks, larger catchment)
- Works with existing infrastructure
- **Status**: Bootstrap reality - what we're actually doing Year 1-3

---

### 🌟 Future Vision: Advanced Water Technologies (Years 5-10+)

**These are long-term aspirations, not budgeted or planned, but something to work towards:**

- **Atmospheric Water Generation**: Creating water from air using solar energy - sustainable, independent water source
- **Advanced Water Storage**: Large-scale reservoirs for wildlife and ecosystem support
- **Smart Water Management**: Automated systems optimizing water use across the site
- **Water Quality Enhancement**: Advanced filtration and treatment systems

**Status**: Vision layer - aspirational technologies that inform long-term direction but don't drive immediate planning. These become viable when:
- Project has proven success and stable revenue (€50k+/year)
- Technology costs decrease or efficiency improves
- Site expansion justifies larger infrastructure investments
- Specific need emerges that justifies the investment

**Current Focus**: Bootstrap-appropriate rainwater harvesting and delivery systems that work within €20-30k Year 1 budget.
