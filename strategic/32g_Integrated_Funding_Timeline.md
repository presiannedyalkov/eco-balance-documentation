# Integrated Funding Timeline

**Core Philosophy: Explore all funding pathways simultaneously, then double down on what's working**

### Month 1-3: Wide Exploration

**Goal:** Test all pathways, gather data, build optionality

**Activities:**

**Crowdfunding Track:**

- **Time:** 3-5 hours/week
- **Investment:** €0-300 (website, social media tools)

**Friends & Family Track:**
- Identify 20-30 prospects (list everyone)
- Have exploratory conversations (5-10 people)
- Gauge interest and feedback
- Refine pitch based on responses

**Angel/Prize/Partnership Track:**

**Bootstrap Track:**
- Always available (fallback)
- Calculate: How much can founders invest? (€5-15k?)
- What timeline is viable? (24-36 months?)
- **Time:** 1 hour/week (financial planning)

**Total Time Investment (Months 1-3):** 12-20 hours/week
**Total Financial Investment:** €0-400
**Output:** Data on which pathways showing promise

---

### Month 4-5: Double Down on What's Working

**Goal:** Invest more in most promising pathways, continue others at lower intensity

**Evaluation Questions:**

**Crowdfunding:**
- Did we build 200+ email list? (Yes = promising, No = challenging)
- Are people excited when we talk about it? (Yes = promising)
- Is social media gaining traction? (50+ followers/month = good)
- **If promising:** Invest €500-1,500 in campaign prep (video, graphics)
- **If not:** Downgrade to secondary, focus elsewhere

**Friends & Family:**
- Did 5-10 conversations go well?
- Do we have 3-5 soft commitments? (€1,000-3,000 pledged)
- **If yes:** Continue outreach, aim for 10-15 more conversations
- **If no:** Reassess ask amount or approach

**Small Grants:**
- Did we find 5-10 good-fit grants?
- Did practice applications get positive feedback (or awards)?
- **If yes:** Submit 3-5 applications in Month 4-5
- **If no:** Focus only on best 1-2 fits

**Major Grants:**
- Is location decided (or very close)?
- Do we have 20-60 hours for application?
- Does our project fit eligibility well?
- **If yes:** Commit to 1 major grant application (DBU or Fundo Ambiental)
- **If no:** Defer to Month 9-12 or Year 2

**Partnership/Angel:**
- Did any strong leads emerge?
- Is there a specific opportunity worth pursuing?
- **If yes:** Invest time in that specific opportunity
- **If no:** Keep monitoring, don't force

**Decision Point (End of Month 5):**
- **Primary pathway(s):** Which 1-2 pathways are most promising? (Invest 60-70% effort)
- **Secondary pathway(s):** Which 1-2 are backup? (Invest 20-30% effort)
- **Deprioritize:** Which pathways clearly not working? (Drop or minimal effort)

---

### Month 6: Commit to Primary Pathway(s)

**Goal:** Make final commitment, launch primary funding campaign, continue secondary pathways

**Typical Outcomes:**

**Scenario A: Crowdfunding Primary**
- Launch crowdfunding campaign (Month 6)
- Continue F&F outreach in parallel
- Submit 2-3 small grant applications
- Monitor major grant opportunities for Year 2
- **Expected funding:** €15-25k (crowdfunding €8-12k + F&F €5-10k + grants €2-5k)

**Scenario B: Major Grant Primary**
- Submit major grant application (DBU or Fundo Ambiental) in Month 6
- Launch smaller crowdfunding campaign (€5-8k) as bridge funding
- Continue F&F conversations
- **Expected funding:** €30-80k if grant succeeds (6-12 months), €8-15k if grant fails (proceed with bootstrap)

**Scenario C: Partnership Primary**
- Finalize partnership agreement (land + support)
- Smaller fundraising campaign (€10-15k for equipment only, not land)
- Apply to 2-3 grants (partnership strengthens application)
- **Expected funding:** €10-20k + land/support from partner

**Scenario D: Bootstrap/Ultra-Lean**
- No external funding worked out
- Commit to founder-funded ultra-lean approach (€10-15k from founders)
- Long-term lease instead of purchase
- Phase investment over 24-36 months
- **Expected funding:** €10-15k (all founder), slow build

**Backup Planning:**
- By Month 6, have backup plan clear
- If primary pathway fails by Month 8-9, pivot to backup
- Example: If crowdfunding raises only €3k (below goal), pivot to bootstrap or lease-land approach
