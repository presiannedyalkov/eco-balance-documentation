## 🌟 Vision of Success

### Long-term Vision (Years 5-10+)

**What We're Building Toward** (aspirational, flexible on details)

**Environmental Impact:**
- Proof-of-concept model proven: 1ha → 10ha → 100ha+ restoration pathway demonstrated
- Measurable ecosystem recovery: biodiversity increasing, carbon sequestered, watersheds healthy
- Replicable methodology: others can follow our approach
- Climate resilience demonstrated

**Social Impact:**
- Restoration jobs created (10+ local, 100+ if scaled)
- Knowledge shared freely (open-source methodologies, training materials)
- Communities benefiting (access, education, livelihoods)
- Movement catalyzed (others inspired to start restoration projects)

**Economic Impact:**
- Sustainable revenue model proven (€50-200k/year if successful)
- Multiple funding sources diversified (not grant-dependent)
- Cost-effective approach demonstrated (€X per hectare, €Y per ton CO₂)
- Investment justified (ecological + economic + social returns clear)

**Systemic Impact:**
- Policy influence (contributing to enabling environment for restoration)
- Practitioner network (collaborating with 10-100+ other projects)
- Open-source sharing (methodologies, learnings, data freely available)
- Restoration as viable livelihood (proved you can make a living doing this)

**How We Get There** (adaptive pathways)

**Year 1-2**: Proof of concept (1ha, learn, document)
**Year 3-5**: Scale if successful (5-10ha, refine model, train others)
**Year 5-10**: Either scale further OR help others replicate (whichever creates more impact)

**Success = Contribution to Global Restoration**, whether through:
- Direct impact (our hectares restored)
- Indirect impact (others using our methods)
- Systemic impact (policy, funding, networks)
- All of the above

**Flexibility**: Exact scale, location, structure, revenue TBD based on what works and where opportunities lead

**Your Legacy** (what really matters):
- ✅ Proved restoration is viable as a livelihood
- ✅ Shared knowledge freely so others can replicate
- ✅ Contributed measurably to ecosystem recovery
- ✅ Maintained integrity and sustainability throughout
- ✅ Created path where none existed before
