## Expansion Strategy - Adaptive Framework

**Vision:** Scale restoration impact across Europe while maintaining quality and financial sustainability.

**Core Requirements:**
- Proven model at 1ha before expanding
- Financial sustainability at each scale
- Maintain founder control and vision
- Expansion only when capacity allows

### Option A: Stay at 1ha, Intensify (Low Risk)

**Cost:** €0-5k/year | **Timeline:** Year 1-5+ | **Risk:** Low

**Description:**
Perfect the model at 1ha, maximize biodiversity and learning without geographic expansion.

**Activities:**
- Dense planting with diverse native species (1,000-2,000 trees on 1ha)
- Extensive monitoring and documentation
- Host workshops and educational programs on-site
- Create showcase demonstration site
- Develop consulting services based on proven methods

**Pros:**
- Low cost and low complexity
- Deep learning and expertise development
- Perfect showcase for methodology
- Manageable workload for 1-2 people
- Lower risk, easier to maintain quality
- Can still generate meaningful revenue

**Cons:**
- Limited total ecological impact (just 1ha)
- May feel small or limiting long-term
- Revenue ceiling lower than larger operations
- Less visibility than multi-site projects
- Slower path to major influence

**Best If:**
- Risk-averse, want to perfect the craft
- Limited capital available for expansion
- Strong focus on education/consulting revenue
- Prefer depth over breadth of impact
- 1-2 person team without plans to scale team

**Financial Model:**
- **Revenue potential:** €20-40k/year
- **Sources:** Workshops (€10-15k), consulting (€10-15k), plant sales (€5-10k)
- **Operating costs:** €15-25k/year
- **Break-even:** Achievable by Year 3-4

**Trigger Metrics (to stay in Option A):**
- 1ha achieving >80% tree survival
- Revenue from education/consulting >€20k/year
- Strong local reputation and demand
- Founder satisfaction with scale and workload

**Status:** Baseline plan for Year 1-3
