## 🎯 Bootstrap Site Requirements

### Essential Criteria (Non-Negotiable)

**Size:**
- **Minimum:** 0.5 hectares (5,000 m²) - absolute minimum
- **Target:** 1 hectare (10,000 m²) - ideal pilot scale
- **Nice-to-have:** 2-3 hectares - allows expansion without moving

**Why 1 Hectare:**
- Large enough to demonstrate methodology
- Small enough to manage with 1-2 people
- Affordable acquisition (€10-30k range)
- Visible results within 1-2 years
- Scales knowledge to larger sites later

**Location:**
- **Within Germany** (simplifies legal/regulatory)
- **Rural/peri-urban** (lower land costs)
- **1-2 hour drive from major city** (accessibility vs. affordability)
- **Reasonable access** (can reach by car year-round)

**Land Use:**
- **Currently:** Degraded agricultural, abandoned pasture, clear-cut forest, or marginal land
- **Zoning:** Agricultural or forestry (easier than residential rezoning)
- **Degradation:** Some degradation present (demonstrates restoration impact)
- **NOT:** Protected nature reserve (too many restrictions), contaminated brownfield (too complex), steep slopes >30% (safety/erosion issues)

**Land Acquisition Budget (Year 1 Bootstrap):**

| Cost Component | Amount (EUR) | Notes |
|----------------|--------------|-------|
| **Land Purchase/Lease** | €5,000-€15,000 | 1 hectare rural land |
| Site Assessment | €1,000-€2,000 | Soil testing, surveys |
| Legal Fees | €1,000-€3,000 | Contract, registration |
| Initial Preparation | €3,000-€10,000 | Clearing, access |
| **TOTAL** | **€10,000-€30,000** | Includes all costs |

> **Note**: This is total land acquisition cost, not just purchase price.
> Leasing options may reduce upfront costs to €2-5k.

### Desirable Features (Not Required, But Helpful)

**Ecological:**
- Some existing native vegetation (head start on restoration)
- Diverse topography (microhabitats)
- Water feature or seasonal stream (wildlife value)
- Not heavily invaded by problem species (reduces workload)

**Practical:**
- Existing access road or path
- Flat building pad for tiny house (20-30 m²)
- South-facing open area (solar installation)
- Some tree cover (shade, windbreak, aesthetics)

**Strategic:**
- Visible from road (demonstration value)
- Near small town (community engagement)
- Proximity to university (research partnerships)
- Expansion potential (adjacent land available)

### Flexible Criteria (Can Compromise)

**Can Work With:**
- Less-than-ideal soil (can be restored)
- Limited water (rainwater + delivery works)
- Some invasive species (manageable with effort)
- Modest slopes (up to 20-25%)
- Basic access (unpaved road okay)

**Deal-Breakers:**
- No legal road access
- Severe contamination
- Active industrial use
- Frequent flooding
- Extreme slopes (>30%)

## 🔬 DIY Site Assessment (Bootstrap Approach)

### Skip Expensive Professionals (Year 1)

**DON'T Spend €11-26k on Professional Assessments**

**DO:**
- Hands-on DIY evaluation
- Local expert consultation (often free/cheap)
- Basic testing only
- Learn as you go

### Basic Site Visit Checklist

**Bring on Site Visits:**
- Camera/smartphone (photo documentation)
- Notebook and pen
- Compass or GPS app
- Measuring tape (50m)
- Shovel or soil probe
- Field guides (trees, plants, birds)
- Water bottles and snacks

**What to Observe:**

**1. General Impression (30 minutes):**
- Walk entire property boundary
- Note topography (flat, sloped, varied)
- Identify distinct areas (open, wooded, wet, dry)
- Take wide-angle photos from multiple points
- Get a "feel" for the place

**2. Soil Quick Check (30 minutes):**
- Dig 3-5 test holes (30cm deep)
- Note soil color (dark = organic matter)
- Feel texture (sandy, clay, loam - squeeze test)
- Check moisture (too dry, too wet, just right?)
- Look for earthworms (sign of health)
- Note any rocks or compaction
- Smell (healthy soil smells good, not sour/sulfur)

**3. Vegetation Survey (1 hour):**
- List all tree/shrub species visible
- Estimate % native vs. non-native
- Note invasive species present (brambles, knotweed, etc.)
- Check understory (grasses, herbs, bare soil?)
- Look for signs of regeneration (tree seedlings)
- Identify any rare/interesting plants

**4. Water Assessment (30 minutes):**
- Any streams, ponds, or wetlands?
- Evidence of seasonal water (dry channels?)
- Signs of flooding (high water marks, debris)
- Any springs or seeps?
- Drainage patterns (where does rain go?)
- How far to nearest water source if none on site?

**5. Wildlife Signs (30 minutes):**
- Animal tracks (mud, snow, dust)
- Scat (droppings indicate species)
- Nests, burrows, dens
- Bird activity (listen and observe)
- Insect diversity (especially pollinators)
- Deer browse damage?

**6. Access & Neighbors (30 minutes):**
- Legal access road or path?
- Condition of access (paved, gravel, dirt?)
- Where would tiny house go? (flat spot?)
- Where would solar panels go? (sun exposure?)
- Who are neighbors? (talk to them if possible)
- Any noise issues? (road, industry)

**7. Challenges & Red Flags:**
- Trash/dumping present?
- Evidence of recent fire?
- Severe erosion or landslides?
- Signs of contamination? (dead patches, chemical smell)
- Utility lines overhead? (ugly, but not deal-breaker)
- Any safety concerns?

**Total Time:** 3-4 hours per site

### Low-Cost Testing (If Needed)

**Soil Test Kit** (€30-80):
- Buy basic NPK + pH test kit (garden center)
- Test 5-10 spots around property
- Record results, look for patterns
- Enough info for bootstrap planning

**OR Free Option:**
- Contact local agricultural extension office
- Many offer free or low-cost soil testing
- Bring samples in ziplock bags
- Takes 1-2 weeks for results

**Water Test** (€30-100, optional):
- If water source present (well, stream, spring)
- Basic potability test kit
- Send to lab if drinking water needed
- Otherwise skip until Year 2+

**Professional Test** (Year 2+, if partnership):
- University research project (free)
- Detailed analysis as part of research collaboration
- Wait until site secured before investing

## 🔍 Red Flags & Deal-Breakers

### Walk Away If:

**Legal Issues:**
- ❌ No legal access to property
- ❌ Ownership dispute or unclear title
- ❌ Liens or encumbrances on property
- ❌ Pending legal action involving land

**Environmental Hazards:**
- ❌ Known contamination (industrial, landfill)
- ❌ Active quarry or mining operation nearby
- ❌ Severe erosion or landslide risk
- ❌ Frequent flooding (check flood maps)

**Practical Problems:**
- ❌ Zoning absolutely prohibits any use you need
- ❌ Imminent eminent domain (road, development)
- ❌ Hostile neighbors or community opposition
- ❌ Price significantly above market (no negotiation)

**Site Conditions:**
- ❌ Entirely steep slopes (>30%) - too dangerous
- ❌ No flat area for any structure (nowhere for tiny house)
- ❌ Completely invasive-species dominated (impossible to restore)
- ❌ Severe ongoing disturbance (adjacent development, quarry)

### Caution Flags (Not Deal-Breakers, But Negotiate)

**Workable, But Reduce Price:**
- ⚠️ Heavy invasive species presence (more labor)
- ⚠️ Some erosion issues (fixable)
- ⚠️ Poor soil (improvable)
- ⚠️ Distance from services (manageable)
- ⚠️ Unpaved access (okay for 4WD)
- ⚠️ Minor zoning questions (resolvable)

**Use these to negotiate lower price or better terms**
