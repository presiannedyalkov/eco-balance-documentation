### Year 5+ Revenue Target: €20-40k/year

**Realistic Year 5 Breakdown:**

| Revenue Stream | Conservative | Optimistic |
|----------------|--------------|------------|
| Research Partnerships | €8-12k | €12-18k |
| Education/Training | €4-8k | €8-15k |
| Donations | €3-5k | €5-10k |
| Grants | €5-10k | €10-15k |
| Eco-Tourism (pilot) | €0-3k | €3-8k |
| **TOTAL** | **€20-38k** | **€38-66k** |

**Year 5 Expenses:** €15-25k/year (operating costs)

**Year 5 Net:** €0-20k surplus (reinvest in expansion)

## What We're NOT Doing (Bootstrap Phase)

### ❌ Energy Sales

**Why Not:**
- Our system is off-grid (not grid-connected)
- 3-5 kW solar is sized for our needs, not surplus
- Grid connection costs €5-10k+ (not viable)
- Feed-in tariff rates too low to justify investment

**Future Consideration:** Year 5+ if expanding to larger sites

### ❌ Carbon Credits

**Why Not Year 1-3:**
- Verification costs €5-15k minimum
- Requires 3-5 years of baseline data
- Small sites generate minimal credits
- Market prices volatile and low for small players

**Future Consideration:** Year 4-5 once we have scale and data

### ❌ Commercial Eco-Tourism

**Why Not Year 1-3:**
- Requires significant infrastructure investment (€10-20k)
- Permitting and licensing complexity
- Marketing and management overhead
- Takes focus away from restoration

**Future Consideration:** Year 4-5 once site is established

## Path to Financial Sustainability

### Phase 1: Bootstrap (Years 1-3) - CURRENT PLAN

**Focus:** Prove the model
**Funding:** Crowdfunding + grants + donations
**Revenue:** Minimal (€0-12k/year)
**Net:** Funded operations

### Phase 2: Early Revenue (Years 3-5)

**Focus:** Build income streams
**Funding:** Decreasing grant dependency
**Revenue:** Growing (€10-40k/year)
**Net:** Approaching break-even

### Phase 3: Sustainability (Years 5-7)

**Focus:** Self-sufficient single site
**Funding:** Minimal external needed
**Revenue:** Stable (€30-60k/year)
**Net:** Break-even or small surplus

### Phase 4: Expansion (Years 7-10)

**Focus:** Replicate model to new sites
**Funding:** Revenue from Site 1 + new site funding
**Revenue:** Growing (€60-150k/year across sites)
**Net:** Surplus for network development

### Phase 5: Network (Years 10+)

**Focus:** Multiple sites, network coordination
**Funding:** Self-sustaining operations
**Revenue:** Diversified (€150-500k/year)

## Legal Structure & Tax Status

### Organizational Form

**Year 1-2 Recommended:** e.V. (Germany) or Associação (Portugal) - Low-cost nonprofit association

**Why Association Structure for Bootstrap:**
- ✅ Tax-exempt status (charitable purpose)
- ✅ Can accept tax-deductible donations
- ✅ Low formation cost (€500-2,000 vs €30-40k for gGmbH)
- ✅ Fast registration (4-8 weeks vs 3-6 months)
- ✅ Suitable for grant applications and crowdfunding
- ✅ Same tax benefits as gGmbH for nonprofit work

**Formation Timeline:**
- Year 1: Form e.V. or Associação (4-8 weeks, €500-2,000)
- Year 1-2: Operate under association structure
- Year 3-5: Consider gGmbH upgrade if commercial revenue justifies €30k+ investment

**Future Option: gGmbH (Year 3-5 if Revenue Justifies)**

**When to Consider gGmbH:**
- Annual revenue reaches €50k+ and commercial activities planned
- Seeking institutional investors or major grants requiring corporate structure
- Scaling operations beyond 5-10 hectares

**gGmbH Formation Costs (if pursued Year 3-5):**
- **Share capital requirement:** €25,000 (legally mandated, held as company asset)
- **Setup costs:** €3,000-8,000 (notary, legal, tax advisor, registration)
- **Total initial investment:** €28,000-35,000
- **Timeline:** 3-6 months from formation to operational

**Status:** gGmbH deferred to Year 3-5 - bootstrap budget (€20-30k) insufficient for €30k+ legal formation. Association structure (e.V./Associação) provides same nonprofit benefits at 2% of the cost.

## Financial Risk Mitigation

### Bootstrap Model Reduces Risk

**Lower Stakes:**
- €50-60k over 3 years (not €500k+ Year 1)
- Gradual investment with learning
- Can pivot or adjust without huge losses

**Diversified Funding:**
- Crowdfunding (community support)
- Grants (institutional validation)
- Donations (relationship building)
- Research fees (credibility)

**Scalability:**
- Start with 1 hectare
- Prove model before expanding
- Can stay small if needed
- Can scale up when ready

**Flexibility:**
- Can adjust timeline based on funding
- Can pause/resume operations
- Can modify approach based on learning
- Not locked into large commitments
