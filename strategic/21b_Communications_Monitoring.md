**Pros**:
- Works anywhere in Europe (no ground infrastructure needed)
- Reliable for remote work (video calls, uploads)
- One-time hardware purchase, predictable monthly cost
- Fast setup (install dish, activate)

**Cons**:
- Requires clear sky view (trees can interfere)
- Power consumption (1-2 kWh/day = significant for small solar system)
- Monthly cost (€500-800/year)
- Dependent on Starlink service availability

**Best If**:
- Site is remote with no fiber/cable access
- Clear sky view available (not heavy forest)
- Solar system adequate (Option B or C can handle 1-2 kWh/day)
- Need reliable internet for work

**Status**: **Primary option** for remote off-grid sites

**Annual Cost**: €480-780/year

- Works as backup if Starlink fails

**Cons**:
- Requires good mobile signal at site (not guaranteed in rural areas)
- Speed/reliability varies by location and time
- Data caps possible (check "unlimited" fine print)
- May not support heavy video calls if signal weak

**Best If**:
- Site has good 4G/5G coverage (test before committing)
- Tight solar power budget (Option A minimal solar)
- Lower monthly cost priority
- Use as backup to Starlink

**Status**: **Check coverage at site before deciding** - Could be primary if signal strong, or backup to Starlink

**Annual Cost**: €240-600/year

### Option C: Hybrid (Starlink + 4G/5G Backup)

**Summary**: Starlink primary, mobile data as backup and power-saving option

**Setup**:
- Starlink for regular work (high reliability, speed)
- 4G/5G for backup and low-power days (winter solar constraints)
- Switch based on power availability and needs

**Cost**:
- Setup: €450-850 (Starlink + router)
- Monthly: €60-115 (both services active)

**Pros**:
- Maximum reliability (two independent connections)
- Power flexibility (use 4G on low-solar days)
- Backup redundancy for critical work

**Cons**:
- Higher monthly cost (€720-1,380/year)
- Complexity (manage two services)

**Best If**:
- Remote work critical (founders income dependent)
- Budget allows €60-115/month
- Site has adequate 4G/5G signal
- Want maximum reliability and backup

**Status**: Possible if work criticality justifies cost

**Annual Cost**: €720-1,380/year
