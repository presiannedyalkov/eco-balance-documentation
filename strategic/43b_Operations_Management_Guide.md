## 🤝 Volunteer Coordination

### Bootstrap Volunteer Strategy

**Goal:** Mobilize 30-50 engaged volunteers Year 1 (people who participate at least once)

### Event Types

**1. Planting Days (2-3 per year):**
- Spring and fall primary planting events
- Target: 10-20 volunteers per event
- Duration: 3-4 hours
- Provide: Coffee, snacks, tools, guidance, gratitude

**2. Maintenance Days (4-6 per year):**
- Mulching, watering, weeding, trail work
- Smaller groups (5-10 people)
- Monthly or bi-monthly
- Less formal than planting days

**3. Monitoring Walks (Monthly):**
- Educational nature walks
- Teach species identification
- Citizen science contribution (iNaturalist)
- 2-3 hour walks
- Casual and social

**4. Work Weekends (2-4 per year):**
- Bigger projects: pond digging, building construction, fencing
- Camping/staying on-site (if space allows)
- Intensive but fun
- Team bonding

### Event Management Process

**2-3 Weeks Before Event:**

- [ ] Purchase refreshments (coffee, snacks, drinks)
- [ ] Weather check and backup plan
- [ ] Final site prep (clear access, safety check)

**Day Before:**
- [ ] Final weather check
- [ ] Prepare coffee/snack station
- [ ] Charge phone/camera for documentation

## 🚨 Problem Solving & Adaptation

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge: Trees Dying**
- Assess cause: Drought? Disease? Pests? Browse?
- Adjust care: More watering? Protection? Different species?
- Replant as needed (within contingency budget)
- Learn and document what works vs. doesn't

**Challenge: Volunteer Turnout Low**
- Reassess event timing (weekends better?)
- Improve promotion (more notice, better messaging)
- Make events more social and fun
- Reach out personally to recruit
- Scale down to smaller events if needed

**Challenge: Budget Overrun**
- Review spending: Where are we over?
- Cut non-essential expenses
- Delay purchases until more funding arrives
- Seek donations or in-kind contributions
- Adjust project scope if necessary

**Challenge: Founder Burnout**
- Take a break! (day off, short trip)
- Ask for help (volunteers, advisors)
- Reduce workload (focus on priorities only)
- Reassess pace (too ambitious? scale back)
- Self-care is not optional

**Challenge: Weather Disruptions**
- Have backup plans (rain day activities)
- Be flexible with schedule
- Use downtime productively (planning, documentation)
- Adjust planting timing as needed
- Accept that nature dictates pace

**Challenge: Lack of Progress**
- Reassess expectations (realistic?)
- Celebrate small wins (progress is progress)
- Document thoroughly (shows change over time)
- Seek advisor input (expert perspective)
- Remember: Ecosystems change slowly, patience required

### Adaptive Management

**Core Principle:** Learn, adjust, improve

**Quarterly Reviews:**
- What's working well? (do more of this)
- What's not working? (change approach)
- What have we learned?
- What should we try next?
- Any emerging opportunities?

**Stay Flexible:**
- Plans are guides, not laws
- Respond to what the site needs
- Adjust to volunteer capacity
- Work within budget constraints
- Pivot when necessary
