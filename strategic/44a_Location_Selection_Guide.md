## 💰 Land Acquisition Options - Adaptive Framework

### Overview

**Philosophy**: Match acquisition strategy to funding available and commitment level

**Key Decision Factors**:
- **Funding Available**: €0-5k → Partnership; €5-15k → Lease; €20-30k → Purchase
- **Commitment Level**: Testing model → Lease; Long-term committed → Purchase
- **Land Availability**: Scarce market → Take what's available; Abundant → Be selective
- **Flexibility Need**: Want exit option → Lease; Want permanence → Buy

---

### Option A: Purchase (€5-30k depending on location)

**Land Costs by Country**:
- **Portugal**: €3,000-8,000/ha (interior regions like Alentejo, Trás-os-Montes)
- **Spain**: €4,000-12,000/ha (interior Castile, Aragon, Extremadura)
- **Germany**: €5,000-15,000/ha (Brandenburg, Saxony, Thuringia)
- **France**: €5,000-15,000/ha (central regions: Auvergne, Limousin)
- **Italy**: €5,000-20,000/ha (interior regions, avoid Tuscany/Umbria premium)

**Timeline**: 1-3 months (due diligence, contracts, registration)

**Total Purchase Costs** (1 hectare):
- Land price: €3,000-20,000 (varies by country/region)
- Notary fees: €500-1,500 (varies by country)
- Legal fees: €300-1,000 (contract review)
- Registration: €200-800 (land registry)
- Transfer tax: €0-2,000 (varies by country)
- **Total**: €5,000-30,000

**Pros**:
- **Full control**: Do whatever you want (within zoning)
- **Permanent**: No landlord, no rent, no risk of losing access
- **Can build**: Structures, infrastructure, long-term investments
- **Asset value**: Land appreciates, especially after restoration
- **No ongoing payments**: One-time cost (except small property tax)
- **Fundraising credibility**: Ownership shows commitment

**Cons**:
- **High upfront capital**: €5-30k needed at once
- **Less flexibility**: Committed to location, harder to exit
- **Property taxes**: Small ongoing cost (€50-200/year usually)
- **Maintenance responsibility**: You own all problems
- **Opportunity cost**: Capital tied up in land vs. operations

**Best if**:
- Crowdfunding/grant successful (€20-30k available for land)
- Want permanence and long-term commitment (10+ years)
- Need to build structures (tiny house, barn, workshop)
- Want full control over restoration decisions
- Confident in location choice (no regrets about geography)

**Status**: Preferred if funding secured (crowdfunding/grant succeeds)

---

### Option B: Long-term Lease (€500-2,000/year for 10-20 years)

**Description**: Rent land with long-term contract (10-20 year lease minimum)

**Typical Terms**:
- **Duration**: 10-20 years (minimum for restoration investment to make sense)
- **Annual Rent**: €500-2,000/year (varies by land value, country, landlord)
- **Upfront**: €0-3,000 (security deposit, first/last month)
- **Renewal Option**: Right to extend for additional term
- **Purchase Option**: Ideally included (price set in advance)

**Timeline**: 1-2 months (negotiate, contract, take possession)

**Year 1 Costs**:
- Security deposit: €0-2,000
- First year rent: €500-2,000
- Legal review: €200-500
- **Total**: €700-4,500 (much lower than purchase!)

**Pros**:
- **Low upfront cost**: Can start immediately with €1-5k
- **Can start quickly**: Less due diligence needed than purchase
- **Test before buying**: Prove model works before major capital commitment
- **Exit option**: Can leave after lease term if needed (flexibility)
- **More capital for operations**: Money not tied up in land purchase

**Cons**:
- **Ongoing payments**: €500-2,000/year forever (or until purchase)
- **Landowner can interfere**: May have opinions on restoration approach
- **Improvements benefit owner**: Your tree planting increases their land value
- **Less control**: Can't build without landlord permission
- **Risk of non-renewal**: Owner could decide not to extend (mitigate with strong contract)

**Best if**:
- Low initial capital (crowdfunding modest or bootstrap)
- Want to test model before major commitment
- Flexibility important (may relocate, scale up elsewhere)
- Found perfect site but can't afford purchase yet
- Purchase option included in lease (rent-to-own path)

**Contract Essentials** (negotiate these terms):
- Minimum 10 years (20 preferred) - restoration takes time
- Right to plant trees and make improvements
- Purchase option at pre-set price (protect against land value increase)
- Right to build small structures (tiny house, tool shed) with permission
- Renewal terms clearly defined (not at landlord's whim)
- Exit terms (what happens to improvements if you leave?)

**Status**: Strong option if crowdfunding modest or as bridge to purchase

---

### Decision Criteria - Land Acquisition

**Timeline: By Month 9-12 - Secure Land** (after location decided)

#### Key Decision Factors:

**1. Funding Available:**
- **€20-30k available** → Purchase land (full ownership)
- **€5-10k available** → Long-term lease (lower upfront)
- **€0-5k available** → Partnership/free land (creative arrangement)
- **Uncertain funding** → Defer or lease with option to buy

**2. Commitment Level:**
- **100% committed long-term** → Purchase (permanent)

- Legal/zoning checks
- Get lawyer review of contracts

**Month 12: Finalize**
- Sign purchase contract OR lease agreement
- Complete payment/deposit
- Register ownership or lease
- Take possession and begin work

**Flexibility:** If perfect land not found by Month 12, continue search into Year 2 rather than settle for wrong site

---

### Site Criteria - Universal (Apply to Any Location)

**Use these criteria regardless of which country chosen:**

#### Climate Requirements:
- **Rainfall:** 400-800mm annual (can go lower with irrigation, higher is easier)
- **Temperature:** Not extreme (avoid &lt;-20°C or >45°C)
- **Drought:** Manageable with water systems (Mediterranean requires planning)
- **Growing season:** Minimum 4-6 months for tree growth

#### Soil Requirements:
- **Degraded okay:** Restoration is the goal, degraded land is cheaper and higher impact
- **Not contaminated:** Avoid industrial contamination, heavy metals, toxins
- **Workable:** Not solid rock or heavy clay throughout
- **Improvable:** Can add organic matter, nutrients, mulch

#### Water Requirements:
- **Ideal:** Nearby stream, spring, or well on property
- **Acceptable:** High water table (&lt;10m) for well drilling
- **Manageable:** Rainwater harvesting + storage tanks if budget allows
- **Avoid:** No water source AND very low rainfall AND no budget for water systems

#### Access Requirements:
- **Road access:** Within 1km (ideally on-site)
- **Year-round:** Passable in all seasons (4WD acceptable)
- **Legal access:** Documented right of way or road frontage
- **For equipment:** Can bring in machinery for initial work (tractor, excavator if needed)
- **For visitors:** Workshop participants and visitors can reach site

#### Size Requirements:
- **Minimum:** 0.5 hectares (manageable but small)
- **Ideal:** 1-2 hectares (perfect pilot scale)
- **Maximum (Year 1):** 5 hectares (limit for 1-2 people to manage)
- **Rationale:** Prove model at small scale before expanding

#### Topography:
- **Preferred:** Gentle slope (5-15%) - good for water retention + erosion control
- **Acceptable:** Flat (easier but may need swales) or moderate slope (15-25%)
- **Challenging:** Steep slope (>25%) - erosion risk, harder to work
- **Avoid:** Extreme slopes (>30%) - safety concerns, very difficult

#### Current State:
- **Ideal:** Degraded land - abandoned agriculture, logged forest, overgrazed pasture, bare land
- **Why:** Cheaper + demonstrates restoration impact + high improvement potential
- **Acceptable:** Some existing vegetation (even if non-native)
- **Avoid:** Pristine habitat (don't degrade good land!) or completely dead/toxic site

#### Neighbors & Context:
- **Ideal:** Friendly neighbors, rural community, supportive landowners
- **Acceptable:** Neutral neighbors, some distance from others
- **Concerning:** Adjacent intensive agriculture (pesticide drift)
- **Avoid:** Hostile community opposition, active industrial neighbors, high conflict risk

#### Legal & Zoning:
- **Must allow:** Tree planting and restoration activities
- **Ideally allow:** Small structures (tiny house, workshop, tool shed)
- **Nice to have:** Solar panel installation permission
- **Understand:** Water collection rights, building restrictions, protected species regulations

#### Services & Community:
- **Distance to town:** 30-60 minutes ideal (services accessible, rural feel)
- **Supplies:** Hardware store, nursery, agricultural supplier reachable
- **Medical:** Emergency services within reasonable distance
- **Community:** Some local community for engagement, volunteers, sales
- **Internet:** Mobile data or fixed line for communication (satellite if needed)

---

### Current Status (As of Month 0)

#### Location Decision:
- **Status:** TBD by Month 6
- **Top candidates:** Germany (if grant secured) OR Portugal (if crowdfunding/bootstrap)
- **Under consideration:** Spain, France (opportunistic)
- **Approach:** Parallel exploration of top 2-3 options until funding pathway clarifies

**Germany Appeal:**
- Strong grant opportunities (DBU, EU LIFE)
- Institutional support
- Familiar culture/language (if applicable)
- Temperate forest restoration

**Portugal Appeal:**
- Very affordable (€3-5k/ha possible)
- Lower cost of living for founders
- Warm climate, longer season
- High restoration need (fires, degradation)

**Decision Trigger:** Which funding pathway emerges as most viable by Month 4-6

#### Land Acquisition:
- **Status:** TBD by Month 9-12 (after location decided)
- **Preferred:** Purchase if crowdfunding/grant succeeds (€20-30k budget)
- **Fallback:** Long-term lease if lower capital (€5-10k available)
- **Creative:** Partnership/free land if capital very limited (€0-5k)

#### Next Actions (Months 1-6):

**Month 1-2:**
- Research land prices/availability in top 3-4 regions (Germany, Portugal, Spain, others)
- Set up property alerts on local real estate sites
- Connect with local contacts, land agents, municipalities
- Join local environmental/restoration groups online
- Begin building network in target regions

**Month 3-5:**
- Visit top regions if possible (budget: €500-1,500 for research trips)
- Meet with local partners, landowners, experts
- View sample properties to understand market
- Assess restoration opportunities and challenges
- Get feel for communities and culture

**Month 6:**
- Align final location choice with emerging funding pathway
- If crowdfunding prep going well → lean toward affordable location (Portugal/Spain)
- If grant applications promising → lean toward grant-rich location (Germany)
- If partnership emerging → lean toward partner's location
- Register entity in chosen country

**Month 7-12:**
- Active land search in chosen location
- Visit properties, negotiate, conduct due diligence
- Secure land via purchase, lease, or partnership
- Finalize all legal and financial arrangements
- Take possession and begin site preparation

#### Flexibility Principles:

1. **Stay Opportunistic:** If perfect opportunity emerges (cheap land, great partnership, major grant) in unexpected location, be willing to adapt

2. **Don't Rush:** Better to take extra 3-6 months to find right site than settle for wrong one

3. **Match Funding to Acquisition:** Align land acquisition timing with funding availability (don't commit before funds secured)

4. **Test Before Committing:** Lease or partnership first if uncertain, purchase later when proven

5. **Keep Options Open:** Research 2-3 locations in parallel until forced to choose
