# Operations & Action Plan - Bootstrap Model

**← Back to [[00_Eco_Balance_Hub|Project Hub]]**

---

## 🎯 Bootstrap Operations Philosophy

**This is NOT a corporate operations manual.** This is a practical guide for 1-2 founders running a hands-on restoration project on a bootstrap budget.

### v2.0 Bootstrap Reality:

- **Scale:** 1 hectare pilot site
- **Team:** 1-2 founders (no employees Year 1)
- **Budget:** €20-30k total Year 1
- **Focus:** Restoration work first, organization building later
- **Approach:** Learn by doing, document everything, stay flexible

**What This Is NOT:**
- ❌ Building a formal NGO (not Year 1 priority)
- ❌ Hiring staff or managing teams
- ❌ Complex organizational procedures
- ❌ Corporate-style operations

**What This IS:**
- ✅ Hands-on founder(s) doing restoration work
- ✅ Simple systems for tracking progress
- ✅ Daily/weekly rhythms that work
- ✅ Volunteer coordination (not employee management)
- ✅ Staying focused on the mission

---

## 🔄 Adaptive Work Model Framework

**Vision**: Operate a successful 1-hectare restoration site while maintaining founder financial security and sustainable work-life balance.

**Core Requirements** (non-negotiable constraints):
- Founders maintain financial security (living expenses covered)
- Sustainable workload (avoid burnout)
- Basic site progress happens (trees planted, monitoring done)
- Quality over quantity (better to do less well than more poorly)

**Work Model Options** - How founders allocate time to the project:

### Option A: Part-Time Model (Year 1-2)
- **Summary**: Founders keep full-time jobs, work on project evenings & weekends
- **Time Commitment**: 15-25 hr/week (2-3 hr weeknights × 5 + 14-18 hr weekends)
- **Living Arrangement**: NOT living on-site full-time, visit site regularly
- **Income**: €30-50k/year from jobs + €0-5k/year from project = Financial security maintained
- **Pros**: Low financial risk, sustainable pace, test model before full commitment, maintain career fallback
- **Cons**: Slower progress, limited on-site presence, harder to manage volunteers, commute time
- **Best if**: Testing viability, crowdfunding/grants take time to secure, want security, living costs high
- **Status**: **Baseline plan for Year 1-2**

### Option B: Transition Model (Year 2-4)
- **Summary**: Founders shift to part-time jobs (3 days/week), increase project time
- **Time Commitment**: 25-35 hr/week on project (3 full days on-site + 1-2 evenings)
- **Living Arrangement**: May live on-site 3-4 days/week, return to city 3-4 days
- **Income**: €15-25k/year from part-time jobs + €10-20k/year from project = €25-45k total
- **Pros**: More project time, can live on-site part-time, still have job income, gradual transition
- **Cons**: Need flexible employer, split time logistics, still not full immersion
- **Best if**: Project showing promise, revenue starting (€10-20k/year), employer allows part-time, want gradual shift
- **Status**: Target for Year 2-4 if Year 1 successful

### Option C: Full-Time On-Site Model (Year 4+)
- **Summary**: Founders quit jobs, work full-time on-site, live in tiny house/caravan
- **Time Commitment**: 40-60 hr/week on project
- **Living Arrangement**: Living on-site full-time (as described in existing daily schedule below)
- **Income**: €0 from jobs + €30-50k/year from project = Must have project revenue!
- **Pros**: Full focus, maximum progress, immersive experience, strong volunteer engagement
- **Cons**: High financial risk, requires project revenue €30-50k/year, no career fallback, isolation risk
- **Best if**: Project revenue is €30-50k/year stable, proven model, comfortable with full commitment
- **Status**: Aspirational for Year 4+ if viability proven

### Option D: Hybrid/Custom Model
- **Summary**: Custom arrangement based on opportunities or circumstances
- **Examples**:
  - One founder full-time, one part-time
  - University research partnership provides salary
  - Grant funds living expenses for 1-2 years
  - Remote work job allows living on-site while employed
- **Best if**: Unique opportunity emerges that enables different arrangement
- **Status**: Open to opportunities

**Decision Criteria** (which model to use):
1. **Financial viability**: Do we have €30-50k/year income secured? → If no, must keep jobs (Option A or B)
2. **Project revenue**: Is project generating €10-20k/year? → If yes, consider Option B; if €30-50k, consider Option C
3. **Risk tolerance**: Comfortable quitting jobs? → If no, stay with Option A or B longer
4. **Progress satisfaction**: Is part-time pace acceptable? → If yes, no rush to change; if frustrated, push for B or C
5. **Living costs**: Can we afford to maintain two residences? → If no, may need Option C sooner (full-time on-site only)

**Work Model Comparison Table**:

| Phase | Timeline | Hours/Week | Living | Jobs Income | Project Income | Total Income | Risk Level | Best For |
|-------|----------|------------|--------|-------------|----------------|--------------|------------|----------|
| **Option A: Part-Time** | Year 1-2 | 15-25 | Off-site (visit regularly) | €30-50k | €0-5k | €30-55k | Low | Testing viability, security |
| **Option B: Transition** | Year 2-4 | 25-35 | Hybrid (3-4 days on-site) | €15-25k | €10-20k | €25-45k | Medium | Gradual shift, growing revenue |
| **Option C: Full-Time** | Year 4+ | 40-60 | On-site full-time | €0 | €30-50k | €30-50k | High | Proven model, full commitment |
| **Option D: Custom** | Variable | Variable | Variable | Variable | Variable | €30-50k target | Variable | Unique opportunities |

**Current Status**:
- **Decided**: Start with Option A (Part-Time Model) for Year 1-2
- **TBD**: Transition timing to Option B or C depends on project revenue and viability demonstrated
- **Decision expected**: End of Year 1 (evaluate if model is working, if revenue growing, if ready for transition)

**Trigger Events** (accelerate to next option):
- Project revenue reaches €10-20k/year → Consider Option B (Transition)
- Project revenue reaches €30-50k/year stable → Consider Option C (Full-Time)
- Major grant secured (€30k+ per year for 2-3 years) → Could enable Option C earlier
- Employer offers remote work or flexible arrangement → Enables Option A/B with more on-site time

**Adaptation Note**: The daily/weekly/monthly operations sections below describe the **full-time on-site model (Option C)**. For Options A and B, operations are scaled down proportionally to time available. See end of each section for part-time adaptations.

## 🚨 Problem Solving & Adaptation

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge: Trees Dying**
- Assess cause: Drought? Disease? Pests? Browse?
- Adjust care: More watering? Protection? Different species?
- Replant as needed (within contingency budget)
- Learn and document what works vs. doesn't

**Challenge: Volunteer Turnout Low**
- Reassess event timing (weekends better?)
- Improve promotion (more notice, better messaging)
- Make events more social and fun
- Reach out personally to recruit
- Scale down to smaller events if needed

**Challenge: Budget Overrun**
- Review spending: Where are we over?
- Cut non-essential expenses
- Delay purchases until more funding arrives
- Seek donations or in-kind contributions
- Adjust project scope if necessary

**Challenge: Founder Burnout**
- Take a break! (day off, short trip)
- Ask for help (volunteers, advisors)
- Reduce workload (focus on priorities only)
- Reassess pace (too ambitious? scale back)
- Self-care is not optional

**Challenge: Weather Disruptions**
- Have backup plans (rain day activities)
- Be flexible with schedule
- Use downtime productively (planning, documentation)
- Adjust planting timing as needed
- Accept that nature dictates pace

**Challenge: Lack of Progress**
- Reassess expectations (realistic?)
- Celebrate small wins (progress is progress)
- Document thoroughly (shows change over time)
- Seek advisor input (expert perspective)
- Remember: Ecosystems change slowly, patience required

### Adaptive Management

**Core Principle:** Learn, adjust, improve

**Quarterly Reviews:**
- What's working well? (do more of this)
- What's not working? (change approach)
- What have we learned?
- What should we try next?
- Any emerging opportunities?

**Stay Flexible:**
- Plans are guides, not laws
- Respond to what the site needs
- Adjust to volunteer capacity
- Work within budget constraints
- Pivot when necessary

## 🎯 Success Metrics (Bootstrap Scale)

### Year 1 Success = Viability Proven

**Ecological:**
- [ ] 100-200 trees planted and survived (50%+ survival)
- [ ] Baseline biodiversity documented (30+ species)
- [ ] Visible site improvement (before/after photos)
- [ ] Soil health indicators improving (earthworms, organic matter)
- [ ] No major failures (fire, flood, catastrophic loss)

**Financial:**
- [ ] €20-30k raised and spent responsibly
- [ ] Staying within budget
- [ ] No debt incurred
- [ ] Contingency fund still available
- [ ] Financial records clean and organized

**Community:**
- [ ] 30-50 volunteers engaged (participated at least once)
- [ ] 3-5 successful volunteer events
- [ ] 100-300 social media followers
- [ ] Local awareness and support
- [ ] Positive relationships with neighbors

**Operational:**
- [ ] Founders still committed and energized (not burned out)
- [ ] Basic systems working (solar, water, housing)
- [ ] Documentation consistent (journal, photos, budget)
- [ ] Learning happening (what works, what doesn't)
- [ ] No major conflicts or issues

**If achieving 70%+ of these metrics = SUCCESS!**

### Success Metrics by Work Model

**These metrics assume Option C (Full-Time Model). Adjust for other work models:**

**Option A (Part-Time) - Year 1 Targets:**
- [ ] 50-100 trees planted and survived (50%+ survival) - *Reduced from 100-200*
- [ ] 20+ species documented - *Reduced from 30+*
- [ ] 1-2 volunteer events (15-30 participants total) - *Reduced from 3-5 events*
- [ ] Visible progress despite limited time
- [ ] **Most important**: Founders NOT burned out, still energized, model sustainable

**Option B (Transition) - Year 2 Targets:**
- [ ] 200-400 trees planted cumulative
- [ ] 40+ species documented
- [ ] 4-6 volunteer events
- [ ] Small revenue starting (€5-15k/year)
- [ ] Path to full-time becoming clearer

**Option C (Full-Time) - Year 4+ Targets:**
- [ ] 1,000+ trees cumulative
- [ ] 80+ species
- [ ] 10-20 volunteer events per year
- [ ] €30-50k/year project revenue
- [ ] Model proven and sustainable

**Key Insight**: Success is relative to work model chosen. Part-time success ≠ full-time success. Measure progress against YOUR model, not an idealized fantasy.

### Year 2-3 Targets

**Year 2:**
- 500-700 total trees (cumulative)
- 50+ species documented
- 10-20% increase in volunteers
- Small revenue beginning (workshops, partnerships)
- Research collaboration started

**Year 3:**
- 1,000+ total trees
- 80+ species
- Measurable ecosystem recovery
- Data published or presented
- Pilot model proven
- Ready to scale or replicate (if desired)

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement

### Learning Culture

**Document Everything:**
- What worked
- What didn't
- Why
- What to try next
- Patterns and insights

**Share Openly:**
- Blog posts (lessons learned)
- Social media (transparent about challenges)
- Conversations with other regenerators
- Presentations (if invited)
- Mentor others starting out

**Seek Feedback:**
- Ask volunteers: What did you enjoy? What could improve?
- Expert consultations (free advice from experienced people)
- Peer learning (other restoration projects)
- Self-reflection (honest assessment)

**Iterate and Improve:**
- Small experiments (try new techniques)
- Compare results (what gives best outcomes?)
- Adopt what works, discard what doesn't
- Build knowledge over time
